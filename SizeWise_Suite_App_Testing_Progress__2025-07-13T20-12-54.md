-[x] NAME:Please help me ensure we're working with the most up-to-date version of the SizeWise Suite app by following these steps: DESCRIPTION:1. **Check for unmerged branches**: Examine the Git repository to identify any branches that haven't been merged into the main/master branch yet.  2. **Evaluate and merge branches**:     - If there are unmerged branches, review each one to determine which contains the latest/most important changes    - Merge only the branch with the most recent and relevant updates (not all unmerged branches)    - If no unmerged branches exist, confirm we're already on the latest version  3. **Test the application**:    - Run the SizeWise Suite app to identify any runtime errors, build issues, or functionality problems    - Document what specific errors or issues are encountered  4. **Fix identified issues**:    - Address each error systematically until the app runs without issues    - Ensure all intended functionality works as expected (please clarify what "100% as intended" means for this specific app)  5. **Commit changes**:    - Only after confirming the app is fully functional, commit all fixes with descriptive commit messages    - Ask for permission before pushing changes to the remote repository  Please ask for clarification on any specific functionality requirements or testing criteria before proceeding with fixes.
