## Welcome to the SizeWise Suite Docs!

This folder contains **all the documentation you (or any future developer or AI agent) need** to understand, extend, and maintain the Air Duct Sizer module inside the SizeWise Suite.  
**Every topic has its own markdown file, so you always know where to look or update.**

**üëâ If you‚Äôre new, read this file first before touching any other docs!**

---

## üìñ How This Documentation Works

- **Every topic only appears once** (no duplication!)‚Äîif you‚Äôre looking for UI details, you go to the UI file. For engineering logic, the logic file. For JSON schema, the schema file.
- This README.md is your ‚Äú**map**‚Äù (table of contents + ownership).
- Whenever you add or change a feature, **start here**: update the map, then the right file.
- If you‚Äôre unsure, always reference this file first!
