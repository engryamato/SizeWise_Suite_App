# SizeWise Offline First

Status: In progress

# **🎯 SIZEWISE SUITE RELEASE STRATEGY & IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING**

Thank you for this comprehensive request! I'll help you develop a strategic release plan for transitioning SizeWise Suite into a fully offline desktop application, followed by the future SaaS platform. Let me start by gathering detailed requirements for Phase 1.

## **📋 PHASE 1 FEATURE PLANNING - DETAILED REQUIREMENTS GATHERING**

### **🔧 Core HVAC Functionality Questions**

- **1. Air Duct Sizing & Calculations:**
    - Should the offline version include all current SMACNA, NFPA, and ASHRAE standards compliance checking?
    - Should we include advanced features like:
        - Pressure loss calculations for complex duct networks?
        - Automatic duct routing optimization?
        - Multiple material types (galvanized steel, aluminum, flexible, etc.)?
    - Do you want to include additional duct sizing methods beyond what's currently implemented?

    ### **1. Air Duct Sizing & Calculations**
    
    ### **Q: Should the offline version include all current SMACNA, NFPA, and ASHRAE standards compliance checking?**
    
    **Answer:**
    
    **No, the offline version should not attempt to include full compliance checking for every provision in all current SMACNA, NFPA, and ASHRAE standards.**
    
    Instead, the offline app should strictly focus on the subset of rules, tables, and compliance checks that are directly required for the core duct sizing and construction validation features—specifically:
    
    ### **A. Duct Construction & Sizing Validators**
    
    - **Pressure Class Validator** (SMACNA, DW/144, AS 4254, EN 1507/12237)
    - **Duct Gauge & Reinforcement Validator** (SMACNA Tables 2-1/2-2, international equivalents)
    - **Aspect Ratio/Shape Validator** (stiffener and max-ratio rules)
    - **Support Spacing Validator** (standardized tables by size/weight)
    - **Airtightness/Leakage Class Validator** (SMACNA, EN, or project-specific leakage classes)
    
    ### **B. Ventilation & Airflow Validators**
    
    - **Minimum Outdoor Air Validator** (ASHRAE 62.1, EN 16798, or local equivalent)
    - **Air Distribution Effectiveness Validator** (code-driven OA adjustments)
    - **Exhaust Rate Validator** (code rates for bathrooms, kitchens, labs)
    - **Maximum Velocity Validator** (design and code-based limits for noise, balancing)
    - **Pressure Drop/Friction Validator** (fan energy and code friction rates)
    
    ### **Implementation Approach:**
    
    - **Embed** all the relevant data tables, limits, coefficients, and algorithms needed to power the above validators **fully offline**.
    - **Do not include** the entire text of SMACNA, NFPA, or ASHRAE standards.
    - **Exclude** standards or code rules that are not directly tied to the validators and features being shipped.
    
    ### **Benefits:**
    
    - **Reduces app size** and keeps the tool responsive for all users (especially field or offline users).
    - **Avoids legal/IP issues** around redistributing complete standards.
    - **Simplifies updates**—only update standards modules/tables as needed.
    
    ### **Modular Data Architecture:**
    
    - Store all compliance tables and validator logic in local, swappable JSON/data files by standard and version.
    - Allow future expansion (other standards or updated editions) via module updates without requiring a complete app rebuild.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Summary Table**
    
    | Feature Set | Offline Compliance Coverage |
    | --- | --- |
    | General Duct Sizing Methods | Only those specifically implemented |
    | Construction Validators | Yes, with all required SMACNA/ASHRAE data |
    | Full Standard Text | **No** |
    | Advanced/Niche Code Rules | Only if they directly support core features |
    
    ---
    
    **Bottom Line:**
    
    The offline version will only include and enforce the rules, tables, and compliance checks necessary for its core duct sizing and construction validation features, using embedded versions of the relevant SMACNA/ASHRAE data. There is no need (and it is not recommended) to bundle or enforce the entirety of SMACNA, NFPA, or ASHRAE standards offline.

- **2. Standards & Compliance:**
    - Which specific versions of standards should be embedded offline (SMACNA 2006, latest ASHRAE, etc.)?
    - Do you want the ability to switch between different standard versions?
    - Should we include regional variations (US, Canadian, European standards)?

- Answer

    ## **2. Standards & Compliance**
    
    ### **Q: Which specific versions of standards should be embedded offline (SMACNA 2006, latest ASHRAE, etc.)?**
    
    ### **Q: Do you want the ability to switch between different standard versions?**
    
    ### **Q: Should we include regional variations (US, Canadian, European standards)?**
    
    ---
    
    ### **A. Specific Versions to Embed Offline**
    
    - **SMACNA:**
        - **Embed the latest widely adopted edition** used by most professionals in your target region(s).
        - *Recommended default:* **SMACNA HVAC Duct Construction Standards, Metal & Flexible, 4th Edition (current)**—since this is the global industry baseline.
    - **ASHRAE:**
        - **ASHRAE Standard 62.1 (latest adopted version)** for ventilation/OA checks.
        - Only the minimum content (tables, rates, multipliers) needed for built-in validators.
    - **Other Standards:**
        - **If supporting multi-region:**
            - *UK:* DW/144 (current)
            - *EU:* EN 1507/EN 12237, EN 16798 (ventilation)
            - *AU/NZ:* AS 4254 (if there is user demand)
    
    ---
    
    ### **B. Ability to Switch Between Standard Versions**
    
    - **Yes—If Feasible:**
        - **Allow users to select which version of the standard they want to use** (e.g., SMACNA 2006 vs. 2018/2021/2024, ASHRAE 62.1–2013 vs. 2016 vs. 2019).
        - **Implementation:**
            - All rule tables and limits must be versioned and modular (JSON or similar), so the validator can instantly reference the correct version per user/project.
            - UI should provide a **dropdown or settings menu** to switch standards (and possibly default per project type or region).
    - **Fallback/Default:**
        - If version switching is out of scope for MVP, **hardcode the current edition** but design data structures to allow easy updating in the future.
    
    ---
    
    ### **C. Regional Variations**
    
    - **Yes—If Targeting International Users:**
        - **Allow switching between US, UK, EU, AU/NZ standards.**
        - Users should be able to pick their country/region at the project or global settings level.
        - **Implementation:**
            - Structure all compliance data/tables to be swappable and clearly labeled by standard and region.
    - **If US/Canada Only:**
        - Only embed SMACNA + ASHRAE (and local US/Canadian code rates as needed).
        - Modular design should allow adding more regions in future updates without major rework.
    
    ---
    
    ### **D. Implementation Best Practices**
    
    - **All compliance tables, coefficients, and lookups should be stored locally** and never require internet to function.
    - **UI should make the active standard/version obvious** (shown on results, reports, and in-app tooltips).
    - **Data files should be easy to update** (e.g., replace JSON in `/data/standards/`) for future code changes or regulatory updates.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Summary Table**
    
    | Question | Recommendation |
    | --- | --- |
    | Which standards to embed offline? | Latest SMACNA & ASHRAE (by target) |
    | Ability to switch between versions? | Yes, if feasible—modular/versioned |
    | Regional variations (US, CA, EU, UK, AU/NZ)? | Yes, if you serve those users |
    | All data offline, modular, and user-selectable? | **Yes** |
    
    ---
    
    **Bottom Line:**
    
    Embed only the standards and versions your users actually need (default to the latest for each region), keep all compliance logic modular and offline, and—wherever possible—let users pick their standard version and regional basis per project. This ensures regulatory compliance and future flexibility without bloating the offline app.

    - **Pros:** Simplest to build; no background network code.
    - **Cons:** Users may run outdated versions; higher support overhead.
    
    **Option B: Semi-Automatic Update & Modular Patching**
    
    - **How it works:**
        1. On startup (or on demand), app checks an update server for:
            - **Core app updates** (new features/bug fixes)
            - **Standards module updates** (new SMACNA/ASHRAE table revisions)
        2. If updates are available, user is notified with version info and size.
        3. User approves download; update is applied in-place (app bundle) or as side-loaded JSON modules.
    - **Pros:**
        - Keeps users informed without forcing installs
        - Standards data can be refreshed independently of the core executable
        - Lean offline footprint—only new modules download

        - Requires server-check logic and UI for update notifications
        - Needs careful version management to avoid mismatches
    
    **Option C: Fully Automatic Background Sync**
    
    - **How it works:** App silently downloads and applies updates whenever internet is available (with rollback safety).
    - **Pros:**
        - Ensures every user is always up-to-date
        - Zero user friction
    - **Cons:**
        - Higher risk of unexpected changes during critical use
        - More complex to implement safe rollbacks and error handling
    
    ---
    
    ### C. Recommendation
    
    **Adopt Option B for Phase 1**—a **Semi-Automatic Update & Modular Patching** strategy:
    
    1. **Startup Check:** On launch (and via a “Check for updates” menu), the app queries a lightweight endpoint for two feeds:
        - **Core App Version**
        - **Standards Module Versions** (JSON bundles for SMACNA, ASHRAE, etc.)
    2. **User Notification:** If newer versions exist, prompt the user with:
        - What’s new (changelog snippet)
        - Download size and impact
    3. **In-Place Update:**
        - **Core App:** Download a delta installer or patch package.
        - **Standards:** Download updated JSON modules and swap them in `/data/standards/`.
    4. **Offline Safety:**
        - Allow the user to defer updates if they’re working offline.
        - Maintain rollback points so that a faulty update can be reversed without reinstalling.
    
    This approach balances development effort, user control, and the need to keep both code and standards data current—while respecting offline usage and keeping installer size manageable.

    - Do you want to collect any anonymous usage analytics for future SaaS planning?

- Answer
    
    ## 14. Data Migration Strategy
    
    **Q: How should offline data be structured to facilitate future cloud migration?**
    
    **Q: Should the offline version include any “cloud-ready” features that are dormant?**
    
    **Q: Do you want to collect any anonymous usage analytics for future SaaS planning?**
    
    ---
    
    ### A. Feature Scope & Trade-Offs
    
    | Feature | Complexity | Benefit |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Schema-Versioned JSON Files** | Low | Simple to read/write; easy to transform for cloud import |
    | **Local Relational Store (SQLite)** | Medium | ACID transactions; built-in change tracking |
    | **Sync Metadata (Change Logs)** | Medium | Enables delta sync; lays groundwork for two-way cloud sync |
    | **Dormant Sync Stubs** | Low–Medium | Pre-wired network checks & queue; no runtime overhead if off |
    | **Anonymous Telemetry Stub** | Low | Gathers usage patterns for SaaS planning; disabled by default |
    
    ---
    
    ### B. Delivery Options
    
    **Option A: Schema-Versioned JSON Only**
    
    - **Data Model:** Each project → one canonical JSON blob, plus ancillary files (drawings, settings).
    - **Migration Path:** Cloud importer just ingests JSON; minimal code changes.
    - **Pros:** Easiest to implement; human-readable backups; small footprint.
    - **Cons:** No built-in change tracking; harder to support partial sync or conflict resolution.
    
    **Option B: Local SQLite with Change-Log Table**
    
    - **Data Model:** Use a lightweight SQLite database with tables for projects, segments, drawings, settings and a “changes” table (timestamp, entity, operation).
    - **Migration Path:** Cloud sync service can consume change-log entries for delta upload; full DB dump for initial seeding.
    - **Pros:** Robust transactions; incremental sync; straightforward to map to cloud schemas.
    - **Cons:** Adds DB engine and ORM layer; slightly larger installer.
    
    **Option C: Hybrid JSON + Embedded Change-Logs**
    
    - **Data Model:** Core entities in JSON; change events appended to a local log file or small DB.
    - **Migration Path:** Parser ingests log then JSON; supports both full and delta sync.
    - **Pros:** Balances JSON simplicity with sync granularity.
    - **Cons:** More complex code to keep JSON and log in sync; potential for drift.
    
    ---
    
    ### C. Recommendation
    
    **Adopt Option B: Local SQLite with Change-Log Table**, plus **dormant sync stubs** and a **telemetry stub**:
    
    1. **Data Structure:**
        - Bundle a local SQLite DB (`projects.db`) with well-defined tables and foreign-key relations.
        - Include a `change_log` table capturing every insert/update/delete with timestamps and entity IDs.
    2. **Cloud-Ready Stubs (Dormant):**
        - Implement a background “connectivity check” module that does nothing offline but can be enabled later.
        - Wire a sync queue component (API client placeholder) that reads `change_log` and would post deltas to a cloud endpoint once activated.
    3. **Anonymous Telemetry Stub:**
        - Build a minimal analytics module that can record event counts (e.g., “project_created”, “export_pdf”) into a local log, but keep it **disabled by default** and clearly documented for opt-in only.
        - This gives you real usage data for SaaS feature prioritization without impacting Phase 1 privacy.
    
    **Why This Approach?**
    
    - **Incremental Complexity:** SQLite is a well-tested, zero-config engine that scales from a single file to millions of records, enabling robust offline operation and easy cloud export.
    - **Future Flexibility:** Change logs make two-way sync, conflict resolution, and partial updates straightforward.
    - **Minimal Overhead:** Dormant sync and telemetry stubs add negligible runtime cost and can be activated in Phase 2 without restructuring your data model.
    
    This ensures your Phase 1 offline desktop app is immediately usable and also architecturally primed for a smooth transition to a cloud-managed SaaS offering.
