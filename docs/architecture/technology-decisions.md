## Overview

This document records all major technical decisions made during the implementation of the Air Duct Sizer tool, including rationale, alternatives considered, and trade-offs.

## Frontend Technology Stack

### React with Next.js
**Decision**: Use Next.js 14+ with React 18+ for the web application framework

**Rationale**:
- Server-side rendering capabilities for better SEO and initial load performance
- Built-in routing and API routes for simplified architecture
- Excellent TypeScript support and developer experience
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Aligns with existing `frontend-nextjs` directory structure

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Vanilla React**: Rejected due to additional configuration overhead
- **Vue.js**: Rejected to maintain consistency with existing codebase
- **Angular**: Rejected due to complexity for this use case

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Faster development with built-in features
- ✅ Better performance with SSR
- ❌ Slightly larger bundle size than vanilla React
- ❌ Framework lock-in

---

### Canvas/Drawing Engine: React-Konva

**Decision**: Use React-Konva (Konva.js wrapper) for interactive drawing capabilities

**Rationale**:
- High-performance 2D canvas rendering with hardware acceleration
- Excellent React integration with declarative API
- Built-in support for complex interactions (drag, drop, resize, rotate)
- Strong event handling system for mouse/touch interactions
- Built-in export capabilities (SVG, PNG, JPEG)
- Good documentation and active community

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Fabric.js**: Excellent features but less React-friendly integration
- **Three.js**: Overkill for 2D drawing, adds unnecessary complexity
- **SVG with D3.js**: Good for data visualization but limited for interactive drawing
- **HTML5 Canvas directly**: Too low-level, would require significant custom development

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ High performance and smooth interactions
- ✅ Rich feature set for drawing applications
- ✅ Good React integration
- ❌ Learning curve for Konva-specific concepts
- ❌ Bundle size (~200KB gzipped)

---

### Styling: Tailwind CSS

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling and UI components

**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach enables rapid development
- Consistent design system with predefined spacing, colors, typography
- Excellent purging capabilities for production builds
- Strong community and ecosystem
- Aligns with existing `frontend-nextjs` Tailwind configuration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Styled Components**: Rejected due to runtime overhead
- **CSS Modules**: Rejected due to verbose class naming
- **Material-UI**: Rejected to avoid design system lock-in

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Rapid development and prototyping
- ✅ Consistent design system
- ✅ Small production bundle size
- ❌ Learning curve for utility classes
- ❌ Potential for verbose HTML

---

### State Management: Zustand

**Decision**: Use Zustand for application state management

**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and simple API compared to Redux
- Excellent TypeScript support
- No boilerplate code required
- Good performance with selective subscriptions
- Easy to test and debug

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **React Context API**: Rejected due to performance issues with frequent updates
- **Redux Toolkit**: Rejected due to complexity and boilerplate for this use case
- **Jotai**: Considered but Zustand provides better developer experience

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Simple and intuitive API
- ✅ Excellent performance
- ✅ Small bundle size (~2KB)
- ❌ Less ecosystem tooling than Redux
- ❌ Newer library with smaller community

## Authentication System

### Custom JWT Authentication

**Decision**: Implement custom email/password authentication with JWT tokens

**Rationale**:
- Full control over user data and authentication flow
- No third-party dependencies or vendor lock-in
- Cost-effective for MVP and scaling
- Aligns with existing backend Flask architecture
- Supports offline-first approach mentioned in project description

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Firebase Auth**: Rejected due to vendor lock-in and cost concerns
- **Auth0**: Rejected due to complexity and cost for MVP
- **NextAuth.js**: Considered but adds complexity for simple use case

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Full control and customization
- ✅ No vendor lock-in
- ✅ Cost-effective
- ❌ More development time required
- ❌ Security implementation responsibility

---

## Export System

### Client-Side PDF Generation: react-pdf

**Decision**: Use react-pdf for client-side PDF generation

**Rationale**:
- React-native approach allows reusing existing components
- No server-side dependencies for basic exports
- Good performance for standard-sized projects
- Excellent TypeScript support

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **jsPDF**: Rejected due to imperative API and limited layout capabilities
- **Puppeteer**: Reserved for server-side complex exports (Pro feature)

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Reuse React components in PDFs
- ✅ Client-side processing reduces server load
- ❌ Limited to simpler layouts
- ❌ Larger bundle size for PDF functionality

---

## Development Environment

### Testing Framework: Jest + React Testing Library + Cypress

**Decision**: Use Jest with React Testing Library for unit tests and Cypress for E2E tests

**Rationale**:
- Jest comes built-in with Next.js
- React Testing Library promotes good testing practices
- Cypress provides excellent E2E testing experience
- Good integration with CI/CD pipelines

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Vitest**: Considered but Jest is more mature for React projects
- **Playwright**: Considered but Cypress has better developer experience

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Comprehensive testing coverage
- ✅ Good developer experience
- ✅ Strong community support
- ❌ Multiple testing tools to learn
- ❌ Longer CI/CD pipeline execution time

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Frontend: Vercel

**Decision**: Deploy frontend to Vercel

**Rationale**:
- Seamless Next.js integration and optimization
- Excellent performance with global CDN
- Simple deployment workflow with Git integration
- Good free tier for MVP development

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Netlify**: Similar features but less Next.js optimization
- **AWS Amplify**: More complex setup for this use case

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Optimized for Next.js
- ✅ Simple deployment process
- ✅ Excellent performance
- ❌ Vendor lock-in
- ❌ Cost scaling for high traffic

---

## Performance Considerations

### Client-Side Calculations with Debouncing

**Decision**: Implement 250ms debouncing for real-time calculations

**Rationale**:
- Balances responsiveness with performance
- Prevents excessive calculation calls during rapid user input
- Maintains smooth user experience

**Implementation Details**:
- Use `useDebouncedCallback` hook for calculation triggers
- Implement loading states during calculation
- Fallback to backend for complex projects (>100 segments)

---

## Future Considerations

### Mobile Responsiveness (Phase 2)
- Consider touch-optimized interactions for canvas
- Evaluate React-Konva touch performance on mobile devices
- May require alternative interaction patterns for small screens

### Collaborative Features (Phase 3)
- WebSocket integration for real-time collaboration
- Operational Transform (OT) or Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)
- Consider Socket.io or native WebSocket implementation
