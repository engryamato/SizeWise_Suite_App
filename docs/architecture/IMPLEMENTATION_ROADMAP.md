## üß™ **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**

### **Testing Pyramid Implementation**

#### **Unit Tests (70% of test coverage)**
```typescript
// Example: WebAssembly calculation engine tests
describe('HVACCalculationEngine', () => {
  test('should calculate duct sizing with SMACNA standards', async () => {
    const engine = new HVACCalculationEngine();
    const result = await engine.calculateDuctSizing({
      cfm: 1000,
      velocity: 1200,
      length: 50,
      fittings: [{ type: 'elbow', quantity: 2 }]
    });
    
    expect(result.diameter).toBeCloseTo(12.5, 1);
    expect(result.pressureDrop).toBeLessThan(0.1);
    expect(result.compliance.smacna).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

#### **Integration Tests (20% of test coverage)**
```typescript
// Example: Database integration tests
describe('MongoDB Integration', () => {
  test('should store and retrieve spatial data correctly', async () => {
    const spatialData = createTestSpatialData();
    await mongoService.storeSpatialData(spatialData);
    
    const retrieved = await mongoService.querySpatialData({
      bounds: spatialData.bounds,
      layerType: 'ductwork'
    });
    
    expect(retrieved).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(retrieved[0].geometry).toEqual(spatialData.geometry);
  });
});
```

#### **End-to-End Tests (10% of test coverage)**
```typescript
// Example: Complete HVAC workflow test
test('Complete HVAC Design Workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Create new project
  await page.goto('/air-duct-sizer-v1');
  await page.click('[data-testid="new-project"]');
  
  // Import PDF background
  await page.setInputFiles('[data-testid="pdf-upload"]', 'test-plan.pdf');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="pdf-viewer"]')).toBeVisible();
  
  // Draw duct system
  await page.click('[data-testid="drawing-tool-duct"]');
  await page.click('[data-testid="canvas-3d"]', { position: { x: 100, y: 100 } });
  await page.click('[data-testid="canvas-3d"]', { position: { x: 200, y: 100 } });
  
  // Perform calculations
  await page.click('[data-testid="calculate-system"]');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="calculation-results"]')).toBeVisible();
  
  // Export results
  await page.click('[data-testid="export-pdf"]');
  const download = await page.waitForEvent('download');
  expect(download.suggestedFilename()).toMatch(/hvac-report.*\.pdf/);
});
```

### **Performance Testing**
```typescript
// Performance benchmarks
const performanceBenchmarks = {
  calculationSpeed: {
    target: '< 20ms',
    current: '100ms',
    test: 'WebAssembly vs JavaScript calculation performance'
  },
  renderingPerformance: {
    target: '60 FPS',
    current: '30 FPS',
    test: '1000+ duct segments rendering performance'
  },
  memoryUsage: {
    target: '< 500MB',
    current: '800MB',
    test: 'Large project memory consumption'
  },
  startupTime: {
    target: '< 2s',
    current: '3-5s',
    test: 'Application initialization time'
  }
};
```
