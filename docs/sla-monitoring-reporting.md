## SLA Compliance Tracking

### Compliance Calculation
```
SLA Compliance = (Compliant Measurements / Total Measurements) × 100%

Where:
- Compliant Measurements = measurements meeting SLA target
- Total Measurements = all measurements in the period
```

### Historical Data Retention
- **Real-Time Data**: 7 days of detailed measurements
- **Hourly Aggregates**: 90 days of hourly summaries
- **Daily Summaries**: 2 years of daily compliance data
- **Monthly Reports**: Permanent retention for trend analysis

### Compliance Thresholds
- **Green (Compliant)**: ≥99% of target
- **Yellow (Warning)**: 95-99% of target
- **Red (Breach)**: <95% of target
