# SizeWise Suite Documentation

Welcome to SizeWise Suite, a comprehensive modular HVAC engineering and estimating platform designed for mechanical engineers, estimators, QA professionals, and project managers.

## What is SizeWise Suite?

SizeWise Suite is an **offline-first**, **modular platform** that unifies duct sizing, vent design, and cost estimating in a single workspace. Built with modern web technologies, it provides:

> **First Offline Release**: Version 1 ships with the **Air Duct Sizer** module only. Additional calculators will be introduced in future updates.

- **Standards Compliance**: Full compliance with SMACNA, NFPA, and ASHRAE standards
- **Offline-First Design**: Work anywhere, anytime without internet connectivity
- **Bidirectional Unit Conversion**: Seamless Imperial/SI unit support
- **Modular Architecture**: Extensible design for future HVAC modules
- **Progressive Web App**: Install and use like a native application

## Core Modules

### üå¨Ô∏è Air Duct Sizer *(Available Now)*
Calculate optimal duct sizes for HVAC systems with SMACNA compliance checking, friction loss analysis, and velocity validation.

### üî• Grease Duct Sizer *(Planned)*
Design grease exhaust systems with NFPA 96 compliance and fire safety considerations. This module is scheduled for a future update.

### üöó Engine Exhaust Sizer *(Planned)*
Size engine exhaust systems for parking garages and mechanical rooms. This module will be introduced in a later release.

### üî• Boiler Vent Sizer *(Planned)*
Calculate boiler vent requirements with code compliance checking. This module is part of our future roadmap.

### üí∞ Estimating App *(Planned)*
Generate accurate cost estimates for HVAC projects with material and labor calculations. Planned for a future release.

## Key Features
