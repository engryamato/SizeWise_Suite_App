# Centerline Drawing Instructions for Augment

# Centerline Drawing in SizeWise Suite

The following instructions detail how to effectively work with centerlines in the SizeWise Suite HVAC snap logic system.

## Fundamental Principles

- **Centerline as Source of Truth:** Centerlines serve as the geometric foundation for all fitting and duct shapes in the system.
- **Arched vs. Segmented:** Round elbows use true arched (curved) centerlines by default, not segmented approximations.
- **Standards Compliance:** All centerlines adhere to SMACNA/NFPA/ASHRAE standards for proper representation.

## Drawing Centerlines

### Activation & Basic Drawing

- Toggle the **Pencil Tool ON** to begin drawing centerlines.
- Left-click to place points and create centerline segments.
- Right-click to pan the view at any time while drawing.
- For round elbows, curved arcs will be generated automatically based on connection points.

### Centerline Types & Toggling

You can toggle between centerline representation types:

- **Arc-based centerlines:** Default for SMACNA-compliant elbows (required for accurate pressure drop calculations)
- **Segmented representations:** Available as user override for special fabrication workflows

Note: When using segmented approximations, the system will display warnings if they fall outside of code compliance parameters.

## Magnetic Snapping System

### Endpoint Snapping

- All fittings and ducts have magnetic endpoints regardless of length.
- Endpoints automatically attract your cursor when drawing nearby (hover on desktop, tap on touch devices).
- Visual feedback appears when approaching snap points.
- Use modifier keys (Ctrl/Alt/Shift on desktop) or long-press (on touch devices) to override default snap behavior.

### Snap Priority Hierarchy

The system calculates the closest snap point using this priority order:

1. Endpoints (highest priority)
2. Centerline points
3. Midpoints
4. Intersections

When multiple snap types coincide or are at equal distances, the system:

- Uses the higher priority snap type by default
- Displays a context menu for manual selection if ambiguous
- Highlights the last-used snap type for consistency in rapid workflows

### Visual Feedback

- Different snap types show distinct visual indicators.
- Indicators adapt opacity based on zoom level and drawing density.
- For overlapping snap types, both are shown with the higher-priority type appearing larger/brighter.
- Toggle the snap legend via toolbar or keyboard shortcut to see explanation of colors/shapes.

## Creating Mid-span Branches

- You can add branches at any point along existing centerlines.
- When snapping to an intersection point while holding a modifier key, the system will propose appropriate multi-way fittings (e.g., double wye).
- If endpoints/centerlines are within a defined threshold, the system may prompt "Suggest Wye?" (requires confirmation).

## Converting Centerlines to 3D

After drawing your centerlines:

- Click the "Build Ductwork" button in the Results/Warnings Bar.
- All centerlines will be extruded into 3D duct/fitting geometry using default or user-set properties.
- Fittings are automatically inserted at each relevant node.
- The system will warn of any open/unconnected lines, overlaps, or code violations.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Undo/Redo:** All snap actions (connections, branches, placement) support undo/redo (Ctrl+Z/Y or touch gestures).
- **Fitting Suggestions:** The system provides intelligent fitting suggestions but never auto-triggers them without confirmation.
- **Warnings:** If centerline types are not code-compliant for selected fittings, export-time warnings will appear with "fabricator notes" in the BOM.
- **Debug Mode:** For advanced troubleshooting, press Ctrl+Alt+D (desktop) or access via settings menu (touch).

**Best Practice:** When creating centerlines for VanPacker integration, include a centerline sketch with drawing requests to speed up turnaround times.
