## Verification Checklist

- [x] Backup branch created successfully
- [x] Branch contains complete old frontend implementation

## Rollback Instructions

If rollback is needed during the cleanup process:

```bash

git checkout backup-old-frontend

# Create new branch from backup
git checkout -b restore-old-frontend

# Merge back to main if needed
git checkout main
git merge restore-old-frontend
```

## Next Steps

With the backup safely created, we can now proceed with:
1. âœ… Phase 1 Task 2: Create backup branch (COMPLETED)
2. ðŸ”„ Phase 1 Task 3: Document current working state
3. ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Update root configuration files
4. ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Remove old frontend files
