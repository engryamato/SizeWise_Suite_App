## 1. What Is This Document?

This file describes **how project data, calculations, and drawings are exported** from the Air Duct Sizer, what fields appear in each format, and what is included/excluded for Free vs Pro users.

- **Does NOT contain:** Calculation logic, UI/interaction flows, schema field definitions (see other markdowns for those).

---

## 2. Supported Export Formats

- **PDF Report**  
  - Print-friendly, formatted summary for sharing or record-keeping
- **Excel (.xlsx or .csv)**  
  - Data tables for BOM, segment schedules, and room/equipment lists
- **JSON**  
  - Full machine-readable project snapshot (for import into other apps)
- **BOM (Bill of Materials)**  
  - Summarized list of all materials, sizes, quantities, and equipment

## 3. Export/Report Content Rules (Free vs Pro)

| Export Content                 | Free Tier                                   | Pro Tier                         |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Project metadata (name, user, etc.)    | All fields                       | All fields                       |
| Room/segment/equipment fields  | All base fields (see schemas)               | All fields, including Pro-only   |
| Computational properties       | Defaults only (shown, locked)               | Custom values if set             |
| Calculated outputs             | Sizes, areas, velocities (basic)            | Full calculations, simulation, pressure loss, D/J loads |
| Warnings/alerts                | All, but limited to Free fields/inputs      | All, including Pro-only warnings |
| Drawing/canvas export          | PDF/PNG with watermark                      | PDF/PNG, no watermark            |
| BOM export                     | Limited to Free item/project/room limit     | Unlimited items/rooms/segments   |
| Export file types              | PDF, CSV/XLS (basic), JSON (basic, no custom props) | All formats, full content        |
| Code compliance references     | Shown as tooltips/footnotes only            | Inline, full references in report|
| Simulation visualizations      | Not included                                | Included if simulation run       |

## 4. Export Workflow

1. **User clicks Export/Print button** (from sidebar or toolbar)
2. **Selects format** (PDF, Excel, JSON, BOM)
3. **System checks user tier and export limits**:
    - Free: If over project/segment/room limit, prompt upgrade
    - Pro: Unlimited
4. **System assembles report/output**:
    - Pulls data from schemas (`data-models-schemas.md`)
    - Runs calculations as needed (`logic-validators.md`)
    - Applies tier-based content rules
5. **Preview shown** (optional for PDF/Excel)
6. **Download or print** (with/without watermark per tier)

---

## 5. Special Export Behaviors

- **Watermark:**  
  - All Free exports include a ‚ÄúGenerated with Air Duct Sizer Free‚Äù watermark
  - Pro exports have no watermark

- **Tier-Locked Fields:**  
  - If Pro-only fields exist, Free users see a note (‚ÄúPremium field: upgrade to access/edit‚Äù)
  - On JSON export, Pro fields are omitted or included as defaults with note

- **Warnings & Code References:**  
  - Warnings are grouped by segment/room, shown in the report; code references provided if available

- **BOM Export:**  
  - Includes all ducts, fittings, equipment in project; Free is capped at limit, Pro is unlimited

- **Simulation Export (Pro Only):**  
  - If simulation was run, PDF/Excel/JSON export includes airflow/pressure visuals and tables

## 6. Sample Export Structure

### 6.1 PDF

- Cover page: project name, user, date, codes
- Table of Contents
- Project summary
- Room list and airflow requirements
- Duct segment schedule (size, material, length, airflow, velocity, pressure loss, warnings)
- Equipment schedule
- BOM (with part numbers if catalogued)
- Drawing/canvas snapshot (with/without watermark)
- Simulation (Pro)
- Warning summary (grouped)

### 6.2 Excel/CSV

- Sheet 1: Rooms
- Sheet 2: Segments
- Sheet 3: Equipment
- Sheet 4: BOM
- Sheet 5 (Pro): Simulation results

### 6.3 JSON

- Full project export (see `data-models-schemas.md` for structure)
- Pro: Includes all custom/computational properties
- Free: Defaults, with note for Pro-only fields

## 7. Keeping This File Up To Date

- Whenever export content, field inclusion, or tier rules change, **update this file and README first**
- Cross-link to schema and logic docs for field definitions

---

## 8. Where to Find More Details

- Data field names and types: `data-models-schemas.md`
- Calculation/logic for outputs: `logic-validators.md`
- UI/export button behavior: `ui-components.md`
- Drawing/canvas rules: `canvas-drawing.md`
- QA/export test scenarios: `qa-acceptance-criteria.md`
