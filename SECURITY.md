- **Security policy compliance checks**

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed
3. **DO** send details to our security team at: [security@sizewise.com](mailto:security@sizewise.com)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix timeline**: Based on severity (see below)
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to update

## Severity Levels

We classify vulnerabilities using the following severity levels:

### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- **Response time**: Immediate (within 24 hours)
- **Fix timeline**: Within 7 days
- **Examples**: Remote code execution, authentication bypass

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- **Response time**: Within 48 hours
- **Fix timeline**: Within 14 days
- **Examples**: Privilege escalation, data exposure

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- **Response time**: Within 1 week
- **Fix timeline**: Within 30 days
- **Examples**: Information disclosure, denial of service

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- **Response time**: Within 2 weeks
- **Fix timeline**: Next scheduled release
- **Examples**: Minor information leaks, low-impact issues

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
- **Never commit secrets** or credentials to the repository
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Validate all inputs** and sanitize outputs
- **Follow secure coding practices** for your language
- **Use parameterized queries** for database operations

### Dependencies
- **Keep dependencies updated** to latest secure versions
- **Review dependency changes** for security implications
- **Use lock files** to ensure consistent dependency versions
- **Scan for vulnerabilities** before adding new dependencies

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Implement proper authentication** for all endpoints
- **Use role-based access control** appropriately
- **Validate permissions** on every request
- **Implement rate limiting** for sensitive operations

### Data Handling
- **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest and in transit
- **Minimize data collection** to what's necessary
- **Implement proper data retention** policies
- **Use secure random number generation**

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be set for production:

```bash
# Application secrets (use strong, unique values)
SECRET_KEY=your_strong_secret_key_here
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key_here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_here

# Database credentials
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_postgres_password
MONGODB_PASSWORD=your_secure_mongodb_password
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_secure_redis_password

# External service keys
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here

# Security settings
FLASK_ENV=production
HTTPS_ONLY=true
SECURE_COOKIES=true
```

### Security Headers

The application automatically sets the following security headers:

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Prevents XSS and code injection
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser XSS filtering
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features

### Rate Limiting

Default rate limits are configured as follows:

- **Anonymous users**: 100 requests per minute
- **Authenticated users**: 1,000 requests per minute
- **Premium users**: 5,000 requests per minute
- **HVAC calculations**: 50 requests per minute per user
- **File exports**: 10 requests per minute per user

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate containment** of the threat
2. **Assessment** of the impact and scope
3. **Communication** to affected users (if applicable)
4. **Remediation** and fix deployment
5. **Post-incident review** and process improvement
