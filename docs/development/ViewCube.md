# View Cube



# Implementation of 3D View Cube in CAD Applications

**Introduction:** The *View Cube* (sometimes called a view *orientation cube* or *view selector*) is a UI widget used in 3D CAD software to indicate and control the viewing angle of a model. It typically appears as a small cube in the viewport, with labeled faces (e.g. Top, Front, Right, etc.) representing standard orthographic directions, and it rotates in sync with the camera. By clicking on a face, edge, or corner of the cube, users can quickly snap the 3D view to a predefined orientation. This tool was popularized by Autodesk as the “ViewCube” around the late 2000s, and similar features now exist in software like SolidWorks (called *View Selector*), AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor, and others. The view cube helps users (especially those transitioning from 2D to 3D) avoid getting disoriented, by providing an always-visible reference for which way is “up” and which side of the model is being viewed[*[1]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20viewpoints,Furthermore%2C%20the%20%E2%80%95closest%20view%E2%80%96%20feedback)[[2]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=view%20to%20more%20easily%20make,the%20viewpoint%20using%20the%20application%E2%80%99s)*. It also serves as a direct manipulation interface for view changes, complementing or replacing older methods like keyboard shortcuts or on-screen menus.

## Architecture and Core Features of a View Cube

A view cube widget is typically rendered as an **interactive 3D cube overlay** in the corner of the viewport. It stays aligned with the scene’s orientation: as the camera orbits the model, the cube rotates correspondingly (acting as a proxy for the camera’s orientation)[*[1]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20viewpoints,Furthermore%2C%20the%20%E2%80%95closest%20view%E2%80%96%20feedback)[[2]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=view%20to%20more%20easily%20make,the%20viewpoint%20using%20the%20application%E2%80%99s)*. Each face of the cube corresponds to a principal view (front, back, left, right, top, bottom), each corner corresponds to a *corner* (isometric/trimetric) view, and each cube edge corresponds to an intermediate view between two principal directions[*[3]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=perspective%20projection,of%20the%20model%20about%20the)[[4]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=views%20are%20accessible%29,the%20car%20is%20facing%20the)*. In total, a full view cube defines 26 accessible orientations (6 faces + 12 edges + 8 corners)[*[5]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=To%20address%20all%20of%20the,ViewCube%20from%20a%20%C2%BE%20view)[[4]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=views%20are%20accessible%29,the%20car%20is%20facing%20the)*. These regions of the cube are made clickable, so selecting one triggers the camera to animate to that exact view.

**Orientation Snapping and Dragging:** A core technique underlying many view cube implementations is an **Arcball-style** camera control with **snap-to-axes** behavior. When the user drags the cube (by clicking and holding on it), it functions like a trackball, freely rotating the camera in an unconstrained orbit[*[6]](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MFIA/2025/ENU/?guid=MoldflowInsight_CLC_NewUser_User_Interface_ViewCube_ViewCube_options_html#:~:text=Moldflow%20Insight%20Help%20,one%20of%20the%20fixed)[[7]](https://www.autodesk.com/learn/ondemand/tutorial/the-viewcube-in-autocad#:~:text=The%20ViewCube%20in%20AutoCAD%20,click%20the%20ViewCube%20to)*. As the drag continues, the system monitors how close the current view is to one of the predefined orientations. If the view’s rotation comes within a certain threshold (e.g. 10°) of a standard orientation, the cube will *snap* to that orientation (“snap-and-go” technique[*[8]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=ViewCube%2C%20it%20can%20be%20very,of%20the%20cube%20using%20a)). This means the cube (and the scene) will automatically **lock into the exact nearest view** to help the user precisely reach orthogonal angles[*[8]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=ViewCube%2C%20it%20can%20be%20very,of%20the%20cube%20using%20a)[[9]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20twenty,closest%20to%20the%20current%20scene)*. The threshold and snapping behavior are often configurable – for example, Autodesk’s default is ~10° for snapping while dragging[*[8]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=ViewCube%2C%20it%20can%20be%20very,of%20the%20cube%20using%20a). When snapping is enabled, the cube provides visual feedback: its outline is drawn **dashed** during free rotation and turns **solid** only when the camera is exactly aligned to a predefined view[*[9]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20twenty,closest%20to%20the%20current%20scene). This gives a clear indication when a “standard” view has been achieved[*[9]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20twenty,closest%20to%20the%20current%20scene). The cube also highlights whichever face/edge is currently closest to the camera’s orientation, cueing the user on which side is “almost” facing them[*[1]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20viewpoints,Furthermore%2C%20the%20%E2%80%95closest%20view%E2%80%96%20feedback)[[2]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=view%20to%20more%20easily%20make,the%20viewpoint%20using%20the%20application%E2%80%99s)*. Together, these features (arcball dragging + snapping + outline/highlight feedback) allow both smooth free-form orbiting and quick snapping to exact axes.

**Click Selection and Animated Transitions:** In addition to dragging, users can **click** on any cube face, edge, or corner to directly go to that view. When a section of the cube is clicked, the camera animates (typically over ~0.5 seconds) from the current orientation to the target orientation[*[10]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=faces%2C%20edges%20and%20corners%20can,cube%20are%20selectable%2C%20when%20the)[[11]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=activates%20the%20command%20to%20set,the%20car%20is%20facing%20the)*. This animated transition helps maintain context, so the user can see the model rotating into the new view rather than “teleporting” abruptly. Most CAD apps allow these animations to be toggled or speed-adjusted. For example, SolidWorks provides a slider to control the View Selector animation speed[*[12]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Image), and Autodesk applications have an option to disable the animation if performance drops in very large models[*[13]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=current%20pivot%20point%20and%20does,or%20faces%20of%20the%20ViewCube). The camera rotation is usually a smooth interpolation (e.g. a SLERP on the orientation quaternion) to avoid awkward shortest-path flips. Notably, many view cubes also enforce an “upright” rule during these transitions: the algorithm will choose an orientation such that the model isn’t upside-down on screen. In Autodesk’s implementation, there is a *“Keep model upright”* option that, when on, ensures the camera rolls as needed so that the world’s up-direction remains at the top of the view (avoiding inverted views)[*[14]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Note%3A%20When%20navigating%20about%203D,of%20the%20scene%20are%20avoided). In practice, this means if you click the Bottom face, the camera will likely do a 180° spin to show the model’s underside with the correct side up, instead of literally viewing it upside-down. This improves usability by maintaining a consistent up-vector for the user.

**Visual Markers and Labels:** The view cube typically displays text labels on its faces to indicate orientation (e.g. “Top”, “Front”, etc.), and may show a small compass or axis triad for reference. Autodesk’s ViewCube, for instance, can display a compass rose below the cube indicating the scene’s North direction[*[15]*](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/inventor-ideas/view-cube-rename/idi-p/5418171#:~:text=6,TO%3A%20Show%20the%20Compass). The faces of the cube in AutoCAD/Revit are labeled with the view names by default (Top, Front, Left, etc.), and these labels can be customized or redefined by the user (e.g. setting a different “front” depending on model orientation)[*[16]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Set%20current%20view%20as%20Uses,the%20current%20view%20to%20redefine)[[17]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=front%20view%20when%20you%20edit,view%20to%20the%20default%20setting)*. In some applications (Revit, Inventor), the user can map the cube’s *Front* to a particular model direction or an existing view (for example, aligning “Front” with the building’s true north or a specific elevation view)[*[18]](https://wrw.is/how-to-change-view-on-viewcube-in-revi/#:~:text=How%20to%20change%20the%20%27Front,Current%20View)[[16]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Set%20current%20view%20as%20Uses,the%20current%20view%20to%20redefine)*. SolidWorks’ View Selector does **not** imprint text on the cube itself; instead it relies on a tooltip/preview that shows the view name when you hover a face, and on the user’s familiarity with the standard orientation positions[*[19]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=You%20can%20see%20a%20preview,corner%20of%20the%20preview%20window). The absence of on-cube text in SolidWorks keeps the cube visually simpler (just a blank translucent cube with highlighted faces), whereas Autodesk’s cube explicitly shows labels or at least the first letter (e.g. “F” for Front) on each face for clarity[*[4]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=views%20are%20accessible%29,the%20car%20is%20facing%20the).

**Additional Controls:** Advanced implementations include extra UI elements on or around the cube. Autodesk’s ViewCube features **on-cube arrows and icons** for quick actions. *For example, when a primary face of the cube is directly toward the user, four triangular arrows appear around that face’s perimeter for one-click access to the adjacent orthogonal views, and small curved arrows in the upper-right corner of the cube provide roll (90° clockwise or counter-clockwise) controls[[20]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=Figure%208,However%2C%20when%20a%20ViewCube%20face)[[21]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=When%20a%20standard%20view%20is,to%20reveal%20the%20Top%20view)*. A “Home” icon (often a house symbol) is shown near the cube as well, which returns the camera to a default home view (usually an isometric view of the model)[*[20]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=Figure%208,However%2C%20when%20a%20ViewCube%20face). These elements make the cube a comprehensive navigation tool: for instance, if you’re looking at the Front face *head-on*, you can click a right-side triangle to go directly to the Right view without needing to rotate the cube first[*[22]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=Switching%20from%20one%20face%20view%2C,We%20replaced%20the%20cones). SolidWorks’ View Selector is more minimal – it does not display persistent on-cube arrows or a home button. Instead, SolidWorks provides separate UI for these functions (e.g. a *“Normal To”* command for face-on views, a Home orientation in its Orientation dialog, etc.). SolidWorks does, however, let you choose the **type of isometric projection** for corner views: using a flyout menu, the user can set whether selecting a cube corner yields an *isometric, dimetric,* or *trimetric* view[*[23]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Use%20the%20Image%3A%20tool_axonometric_drop_down,select%20a%20View%20Selector%20corner). (This adjusts the exact angles used for the “corner” orientations – by default SolidWorks uses trimetric, whereas Autodesk’s corner views are typically isometric projections.) Other options found in view cube implementations include toggling between perspective and orthographic projection. Inventor’s ViewCube, for example, has a *“Perspective with Ortho Faces”* mode, which keeps the view in perspective generally but temporarily switches to orthographic when you snap to a perfect face-on view[*[24]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=displayed%20just%20above%20the%20ViewCube,does%20not%20change%20regardless%20of)[[25]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=perspective%2C%20very%20similar%20to%20the,view%20as%20the%20default%20view)*. This way, you get true flat orthographic elevations when looking directly at a face, but retain perspective for free rotations – a useful compromise in design review.

**Rendering and Interaction Implementation:** Under the hood, a view cube is often drawn using a secondary, fixed camera or overlay in the 3D engine. The cube might be rendered with an orthographic camera positioned in the corner of the screen (so it always appears the same size and orientation relative to the viewport), or drawn in a HUD/overlay layer. It typically ignores scene depth (so other geometry doesn’t occlude it) and uses simple shading or color coding for hover highlights. Interaction is usually implemented by hit-testing the cube’s regions. Some software treat each cube face/edge/corner as a separate clickable button. For instance, one developer replicating the ViewCube in the Bevy engine described subdividing a cube into 26 independent hit areas (one for each face/edge/corner) and using ray casting for selection[*[26]](https://www.reddit.com/r/bevy/comments/13387b9/any_example_of_autocad_viewcube/#:~:text=I%20thought%20this%20was%20a,rotation%20on%20click%20in%20bevy)[[27]](https://www.reddit.com/r/bevy/comments/13387b9/any_example_of_autocad_viewcube/#:~:text=PhaestusFox%20%20%E2%80%A2%20%20upvotes,%E2%80%A2%202y%20ago)*. Others compute the hit target by transforming the 2D click position into the cube’s local coordinates. Because the cube orientation is known, one can derive which face was clicked by the vector of the ray in cube space (e.g. a click corresponding to a +X direction hit means the “Right” face). The math for determining orientations is straightforward: each face corresponds to a 90° axis rotation, edges correspond to 45° rotations about two axes, and corners to 45° about three axes. In practice, implementations often just predefine the view quaternion for each of the 26 views instead of calculating from scratch every time (for example, storing quaternions for Front, Back, Front-Right, Front-Top, Front-Top-Right, etc.). Animation from the current camera orientation to the target is then performed (either by immediate snap or over a short duration as discussed).

**Performance considerations:** Because the view cube is updated in real-time with the camera, it must be efficient to render. The cube itself is very low-polygon (6 faces); even with text or arrows, it’s not geometry-heavy. The potential performance hit comes from the event of animating the whole model view for transitions – large models can drop frames during a smooth transition. Autodesk notes that on extremely heavy scenes, the frame rate might stutter and suggests disabling animated transitions in those cases[*[13]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=current%20pivot%20point%20and%20does,or%20faces%20of%20the%20ViewCube). Another consideration is **usability vs. screen space**: a cube widget should be small enough not to obscure the model, but large enough to be easily clickable. Many programs let the user adjust the cube’s size and screen position. For example, Inventor’s options allow sizes from “Tiny” to “Large” and placement in any corner of the screen[*[28]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Only%20in%20Current%20View%20When,means%20that%20the)[[29]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=On%20Screen%20Position%20Allows%20you,Whatever%20the%20settings%20may%20be)*. There’s also an *inactive opacity* setting: the cube can fade when not in use (e.g. 50% transparent) and become fully opaque on hover[*[30]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=ViewCube%20Size%20Allows%20you%20to,for%20dragging%20on%20the%20ViewCube). This ensures the widget doesn’t visually compete with the model until the user wants to interact with it.

**Summary of Common Techniques:** In summary, modern view cubes implement a combination of: (1) **Arcball rotation** for free orbit (often referencing Shoemake’s 1992 “ArcBall” technique[*[31]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L776%20SHOEMAKE%2C%20K,Visualizing%203D%20Scenes)), (2) **snapping** to exact axes using a threshold (improving alignment for standard views)[*[8]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=ViewCube%2C%20it%20can%20be%20very,of%20the%20cube%20using%20a)[[9]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20twenty,closest%20to%20the%20current%20scene)*, (3) **visual feedback** (highlighted faces, solid/dashed outlines for lock-on)[*[9]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20twenty,closest%20to%20the%20current%20scene)[[32]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20viewpoints,to%20%E2%80%95repair%E2%80%96%20or%20align%20the)*, (4) **animated smooth transitions** for clicks, respecting an “upright” orientation rule[*[14]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Note%3A%20When%20navigating%20about%203D,of%20the%20scene%20are%20avoided), (5) **labeled faces** and optional compass/axis indicators for clarity, and (6) **customization settings** for size, opacity, behavior (snapping on/off, fit-to-view, projection mode, etc.)[*[33]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=When%20Dragging%20on%20the%20ViewCube,as%20the%20pivot%20point%20while)[[34]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=When%20Clicking%20on%20the%20ViewCube,views%20An%20animated%20transition%20displays)*. With this architectural overview in mind, we now examine how three specific CAD applications implement their view cube variants and highlight their differences.

## SolidWorks View Selector (3D Orientation Cube in SolidWorks)

SolidWorks introduced its version of the view cube, called the **View Selector**, in SolidWorks 2013. Unlike Autodesk’s always-displayed cube, SolidWorks’ View Selector is an *on-demand* tool: it appears **only when invoked** (typically by pressing **Ctrl+Spacebar** or hitting the spacebar to open the Orientation menu) and disappears after a view is selected[*[35]](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Press%20Ctrl%20%2B%20Spacebar%20or,in%20the%20Orientation%20dialog%20box)[[36]](http://www.fcsuper.com/swblog/?p=3622#:~:text=Image%3A%20Selecting%20the%20View%20SelectorAnother,launch%20the%20Orientation%20dialog%20box)*. In other words, it’s a transient overlay rather than a persistent UI element. When activated, a semi-transparent cube is drawn centered in the viewport, showing the model’s orientation. The cube presents the standard six faces (front/back, left/right, top/bottom) and the eight corner views (isometric variants). **Face selection:** To choose a view, the user hovers and then clicks one of the faces or corners of the cube. As you hover over a face, SolidWorks will show a **preview** of the model from that orientation in a small popup or as an outline, and the name of the view (if it corresponds to a standard view) appears in the corner of the screen[*[19]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=You%20can%20see%20a%20preview,corner%20of%20the%20preview%20window). Clicking the face then smoothly rotates the model to that view. By default, the cube shows the front side orientations; to access the back side (the orientations on the far side of the cube), the user holds **Alt** while hovering/clicking[*[37]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=the%20View%20Selector%20to%20select,of%20the%20View%20Selector%20cube). With Alt held, the cube will highlight and allow selection of the backside faces (e.g. Back, Back-Right, etc.)[*[37]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=the%20View%20Selector%20to%20select,of%20the%20View%20Selector%20cube). This two-step approach (Alt for back) is because the View Selector doesn’t allow free rotation of the cube by dragging – it’s a static orientation widget, so backside views would normally be hidden. SolidWorks’ solution was to either let the user *“explode”* the cube or use a modifier key. In fact, if you linger over the cube, SolidWorks will slightly **explode the hidden faces outward** from the cube’s center, offsetting the back faces so that they become visible and clickable without needing to rotate the cube itself[*[38]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Planes%20that%20are%20obscured%20because,select%20without%20rotating%20the%20model). This is illustrated by back faces (and some side faces) floating just outside the cube when they are obscured[*[38]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Planes%20that%20are%20obscured%20because,select%20without%20rotating%20the%20model). In effect, SolidWorks ensures all faces can be reached in one interaction, at the cost of a somewhat abstract “exploded” visualization.

**Interaction design:** The View Selector in SolidWorks is **not draggable** – the user cannot click-drag to freely orbit when this mode is active. (SolidWorks uses a separate mechanism for regular orbiting, e.g. middle-mouse dragging or the Rotate tool.) The View Selector is purely a selection interface: you click a facet to go there. This design aligns with its ephemeral nature – it pops up as a shortcut menu of views rather than a second, alternate orbit control. That contrasts with Autodesk’s cube which doubles as an always-on orbit handle. SolidWorks likely made this choice to avoid conflicts with its existing rotate/pan controls and to keep the selector usage very straightforward (click and done).

**Orientation options:** SolidWorks offers an option to control what happens when you choose a *corner* (isometric) orientation. Via a flyout in the Orientation dialog, the user can specify whether the cube’s corner corresponds to an **Isometric, Dimetric, or Trimetric** projection[*[23]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Use%20the%20Image%3A%20tool_axonometric_drop_down,select%20a%20View%20Selector%20corner). These terms refer to the angles between axes in the view. SolidWorks by default uses trimetric (their standard “Isometric” view in the UI is actually a trimetric projection). But if a user prefers a true isometric (equal angles between all axes) or dimetric view, they can change this setting and then the View Selector’s corner orientations will reflect that choice[*[23]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Use%20the%20Image%3A%20tool_axonometric_drop_down,select%20a%20View%20Selector%20corner). This is a unique feature – by contrast, Autodesk’s ViewCube typically uses a fixed isometric-like view for its corners (and doesn’t expose multiple axonometric options to the user in the UI).

**Animation and customization:** When a view is selected from the cube, SolidWorks animates the transition. The speed of this rotation animation can be configured in SolidWorks’ System Options. As noted in documentation, *Tools > Options > System Options > View > “View Selector speed”* allows the user to adjust how fast the cube animation turns[*[12]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Image). Setting it to the fastest essentially makes the transition instantaneous, whereas slower settings animate a smooth turn. Some users who find the animation jarring can turn it off by sliding that to “Off” (in fact, one SolidWorks blog suggests disabling the animation if it bothers you[*[39]*](https://www.solidsolutions.co.uk/blog/2013/07/instant-view-selector-tip/#:~:text=Instant%20View%20Selector%20Tip%20,as%20in%20the%20image%20below)). Additionally, SolidWorks provides a *“preview”* behavior: as you hover over different faces of the cube (without clicking), the model will temporarily *ghost* into that orientation, giving you an idea of what the view will look like[*[19]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=You%20can%20see%20a%20preview,corner%20of%20the%20preview%20window). This preview window updates in real-time as you move the pointer across various facets. If the hovered orientation corresponds to a standard named view, SolidWorks also overlays the view name in the corner of the preview, e.g. “Right”, “Isometric”, etc.[*[19]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=You%20can%20see%20a%20preview,corner%20of%20the%20preview%20window). This helps ensure you select the intended view.

**Unique aspects and limitations:** Because the SolidWorks View Selector is not persistent, some users have requested the ability to pin it or have it always visible (similar to Fusion 360’s cube)[*[40]*](https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidWorks/comments/195lg5i/pin_view_selector_to_top_right_hand_corner/#:~:text=Pin%20view%20selector%20to%20top,a%20example%20from%20Fusion360%20below). As of SolidWorks 2019–2020, there is an option in the Orientation dialog to “pin” the View Selector, which will keep it on-screen (in a fixed location) even after use. However, even pinned, it doesn’t act exactly like Autodesk’s (it may still disable after a click until reactivated, based on forum discussions). Also, SolidWorks only shows the cube in a perspective style view (the cube is slightly in perspective projection for depth). It does not label the faces on the cube itself with text or letters – it relies on the preview text and the user’s understanding that, for example, the top face of the cube corresponds to whatever view is currently the model’s top orientation. Lastly, because you cannot drag-rotate the cube, SolidWorks had to implement the above-mentioned “explode” for hidden faces. Autodesk’s view cube instead would simply let you **drag** to rotate the cube around to see the back. This difference means the interaction paradigms are a bit different: SolidWorks’ method is a quick *one-shot selection tool*, whereas Autodesk’s can be both a selection tool and a general-purpose orbit handle.

**Summary (SolidWorks):** The SolidWorks View Selector (introduced in 2013) provides a quick, visual way to reorient to standard views. It appears on-demand (Ctrl+Space) as a semi-transparent cube. You can click any face or corner to go to that view; holding Alt lets you access the backside views[*[37]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=the%20View%20Selector%20to%20select,of%20the%20View%20Selector%20cube). The widget previews orientations on hover and animates the transition when selected. It includes opposite-side views (so you can get “Back” as easily as “Front”) and allows customizing the type of isometric view for corners[*[23]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Use%20the%20Image%3A%20tool_axonometric_drop_down,select%20a%20View%20Selector%20corner). However, it does not support dragging for arbitrary rotation – regular view manipulation in SolidWorks is done via other controls. The View Selector’s design addresses hidden faces by exploding them outward for selection[*[38]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Planes%20that%20are%20obscured%20because,select%20without%20rotating%20the%20model), and it emphasizes simplicity and integration with the existing Orientation menu (for example, it’s toggled via the same dialog that lists saved views, etc. [*[36]*](http://www.fcsuper.com/swblog/?p=3622#:~:text=Image%3A%20Selecting%20the%20View%20SelectorAnother,launch%20the%20Orientation%20dialog%20box)). Many users find it useful for rapidly selecting a known orthogonal view without manually rotating the model, while others treat it as an optional aid (and it can be turned off entirely in the options).

## Autodesk AutoCAD ViewCube

Autodesk’s **ViewCube** (used in AutoCAD, Inventor, 3ds Max, Navisworks, and Revit, among others) is the canonical implementation of this feature. In AutoCAD, the ViewCube is a **persistent, interactive cube** UI usually shown in the upper-right corner of the 3D modeling viewport[*[41]*](https://help.autodesk.com/view/ALIAS/2025/ENU/?guid=Alias_Interface_and_General_Tasks_Viewcube_tools_html#:~:text=Alias%202025%20,isometric%2Forthographic%20views%20of%20your). (It can be repositioned or disabled via settings, but by default it’s always visible in 3D visual styles.) The cube provides a *360° navigation interface*: the user can **click and drag** the cube freely to orbit, or click on any of its faces/edges/corners to snap to that orientation[*[7]](https://www.autodesk.com/learn/ondemand/tutorial/the-viewcube-in-autocad#:~:text=The%20ViewCube%20in%20AutoCAD%20,click%20the%20ViewCube%20to)[[42]](https://help.autodesk.com/view/ALIAS/2025/ENU/?guid=Alias_Interface_and_General_Tasks_Viewcube_tools_html#:~:text=that%20you%20use%20to%20switch,isometric%2Forthographic%20views%20of%20your)*. The ViewCube in AutoCAD is deeply integrated into the view manipulation system, working in tandem with the standard orbit/pan/zoom controls.

**Interaction design:** *Dragging* the ViewCube causes the model view to orbit in an **arcball-like fashion** around a pivot point[*[6]](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MFIA/2025/ENU/?guid=MoldflowInsight_CLC_NewUser_User_Interface_ViewCube_ViewCube_options_html#:~:text=Moldflow%20Insight%20Help%20,one%20of%20the%20fixed)[[33]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=When%20Dragging%20on%20the%20ViewCube,as%20the%20pivot%20point%20while)*. By default, the pivot is the center of the model or the current view’s target. (AutoCAD has a concept of view “pivot” or center; the cube will use the view’s center of rotation. There is an option to either keep using the current pivot or to auto-fit the model on view change. For instance, enabling *“Fit-to-view on view change”* means when you click a ViewCube face, it recenters and zooms the model to fit the screen[*[43]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=like%20an%20arcball,not%20zoom%20in%20or%20out)[[34]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=When%20Clicking%20on%20the%20ViewCube,views%20An%20animated%20transition%20displays)*. If that is off, the cube will rotate the view about the current pivot and not change zoom.) As the user drags, if *“Snap to closest view”* is enabled, the cube will auto-snap when the drag comes near a major orientation[*[6]](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MFIA/2025/ENU/?guid=MoldflowInsight_CLC_NewUser_User_Interface_ViewCube_ViewCube_options_html#:~:text=Moldflow%20Insight%20Help%20,one%20of%20the%20fixed)[[33]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=When%20Dragging%20on%20the%20ViewCube,as%20the%20pivot%20point%20while)*. Specifically, within a threshold (~10°), it will lock onto the nearest of the 26 preset views[*[8]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=ViewCube%2C%20it%20can%20be%20very,of%20the%20cube%20using%20a)[[44]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=added%20view%20snapping,see%20Figure%206)*. This snapping behavior can be toggled in the options. The effect is that you can roughly rotate the model by dragging the cube, and as you approach say the Top view, it will click into the exact Top alignment without requiring pixel-perfect manual alignment. The **outline of the cube** changes to indicate this: a dashed outline while dragging (free rotation), and it turns to a solid outline once snapped exactly to a preset view[*[9]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20twenty,closest%20to%20the%20current%20scene). This gives immediate feedback that, for example, you’re exactly on “Front” or “Front-Right” instead of just almost there. Users can disable snapping if they prefer a completely continuous orbit (in which case the cube will allow arbitrary angles). AutoCAD’s implementation of dragging essentially invokes the same operation as the regular 3DORBIT command, but constrained through the cube widget, making it intuitive for users less comfortable with command-line orbit.

**Clicking on the cube:** The ViewCube’s faces and corners act as buttons. As you hover over them, they highlight. If you click a **face** (e.g. “Top”), the camera animates to that orthographic view (pointing straight down at the model, in AutoCAD’s case Z-axis down)[*[45]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=faces%2C%20edges%20and%20corners%20can,the%20car%20is%20facing%20the)[[11]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=activates%20the%20command%20to%20set,the%20car%20is%20facing%20the)*. If you click a **corner**, it animates to an isometric view (by default, 45° rotations around two axes – the standard isometric). Clicking an **edge** between faces gives a view rotated 45° between two orthogonal directions (for example, clicking the edge between Front and Right yields a “front-right” view at a 45° angle in between). These intermediate views are part of the 26 supported orientations. The transition is animated for clarity, usually over half a second, and uses smooth interpolation.

Notably, Autodesk’s ViewCube provides additional on-screen aids when clicking: if you click a face that is currently visible, it goes directly there; but if you need a face that’s on the far side, you *could* either drag the cube around or simply click one of the **arrow/triangle markers** that Autodesk provides for quick flipping. When the cube is oriented such that one face is directly toward the user (i.e. you are in a primary orthographic view), Autodesk displays four **triangular wedges** around the cube (pointing up, down, left, right)[*[21]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=When%20a%20standard%20view%20is,to%20reveal%20the%20Top%20view). These are essentially a carryover of the older “ViewCompass” – clicking one of these triangles will rotate the view 90° in that direction to the adjacent face[*[22]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=Switching%20from%20one%20face%20view%2C,We%20replaced%20the%20cones). For example, if you are looking at the Front face head-on and you want to go to the Right face, you don’t have to drag the cube or do two clicks (Front-to-corner, then corner-to-Right); you can simply click the triangle on the right side of the cube and it will rotate directly to Right view in one step[*[22]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=Switching%20from%20one%20face%20view%2C,We%20replaced%20the%20cones)[[46]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=one%20click%20on%20the%20Front,The%20ViewCube%20can)*. This is a usability enhancement: it avoids an extra click as described in Autodesk’s research[*[22]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=Switching%20from%20one%20face%20view%2C,We%20replaced%20the%20cones). Similarly, AutoCAD’s ViewCube has small **“roll” arrows** at its top-right corner. Clicking these will rotate the view 90° about the viewing axis (clockwise or counter-clockwise)[*[47]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=5,click%20the%20Home%20View%20icon). This is useful for adjusting the view when it’s slightly tilted – for instance, if you’re looking at the Front, a roll arrow will rotate the camera such that the model appears upside down or right-side up. Typically, the ViewCube tries to keep the model upright automatically (the *“Keep scene upright”* function ensures that when switching views, it defaults to the orientation with the top of the model facing up on screen[*[14]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Note%3A%20When%20navigating%20about%203D,of%20the%20scene%20are%20avoided)). But if the user *wants* to view the model upside down or at 90° rotation (for documentation or preferences), the roll controls allow that explicitly.

*Autodesk’s ViewCube UI (as seen in Inventor) with interactive elements highlighted. When a face is square-on (here “Top”), four triangular arrows appear around it for one-click access to adjacent views (Front, Back, Left, Right). Curved arrows at the upper-right provide 90° roll rotations. A Home icon (upper left) resets the view to a default orientation[[20]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=Figure%208,However%2C%20when%20a%20ViewCube%20face). Face labels (like “Top”) are shown on each face.*

The ViewCube is also typically accompanied by a **“Home”** button (usually above the cube). In AutoCAD, clicking the Home icon restores the view to a saved home position (commonly an isometric view of the model). Users can set the current view as the new Home via a right-click menu on the cube[*[48]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=ViewCube%20Menu%20%20Go%20Home,real%20world%20are%20perceived%20by)[[49]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Set%20current%20view%20as%20Home,view%20as%20the%20default%20view)*. The right-click (context) menu on the ViewCube in AutoCAD/Inventor provides many options: toggling between orthographic/perspective projection, setting current view as Front/Top (to redefine the cube’s orientation)[*[16]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Set%20current%20view%20as%20Uses,the%20current%20view%20to%20redefine)[[17]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=front%20view%20when%20you%20edit,view%20to%20the%20default%20setting)*, adjusting the cube’s settings (size, opacity, etc.), and resetting to defaults. This menu essentially exposes all the ViewCube preferences in one spot for convenience.

**Customization and settings:** AutoCAD’s (and generally Autodesk’s) ViewCube is highly customizable through the Options dialog or the right-click menu. Key settings include:- **Show/Hide the ViewCube:** Users can turn it off entirely or have it only appear in certain visual styles or in 3D views. For example, 2D Wireframe mode might hide the cube by default, whereas 3D modes show it. Inventor has “Show the ViewCube in all 3D views” vs. “only in current view” options[*[50]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Show%20the%20ViewCube%20on%20window,position%20of%20the%20ViewCube%20to).- **Size and Position:** The ViewCube can be set to “Tiny/Small/Normal/Large”[*[29]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=On%20Screen%20Position%20Allows%20you,Whatever%20the%20settings%20may%20be) and anchored to any corner of the window (top-right, bottom-right, etc.)[*[28]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Only%20in%20Current%20View%20When,means%20that%20the).- **Inactive Opacity:** As mentioned, you can have it fade when not in use (e.g. 50% or 0% = completely hidden until hover)[*[30]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=ViewCube%20Size%20Allows%20you%20to,for%20dragging%20on%20the%20ViewCube).- **Snap to closest view:** A checkbox to enable/disable the snapping during drag[*[33]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=When%20Dragging%20on%20the%20ViewCube,as%20the%20pivot%20point%20while).- **Fit-to-view on change:** Option to zoom extents when clicking a new view[*[43]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=like%20an%20arcball,not%20zoom%20in%20or%20out). For instance, with this on, if you click “Top”, the camera will not only go to top view but also adjust the zoom so the model extents fit the viewport (this prevents scenarios where you switch views and your model is half out of frame). If off, it will just rotate in place, maintaining the same zoom distance.- **Use animated transitions:** Can be turned off if the user prefers an instant jump when selecting a view[*[13]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=current%20pivot%20point%20and%20does,or%20faces%20of%20the%20ViewCube).- **Keep scene upright:** As described, can be toggled, though it’s usually on by default because it makes navigation more consistent[*[51]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Note%3A%20When%20navigating%20about%203D,of%20the%20scene%20are%20avoided).

Because the ViewCube is common across many Autodesk products, these settings are quite standardized. The actual look-and-feel can be slightly different (e.g. color scheme) depending on the software’s UI theme, but the behavior is consistent.

**Revit ViewCube vs AutoCAD:** Revit uses essentially the same ViewCube component, so much of the above applies to Revit as well – we will discuss Revit-specific notes in the next section. In AutoCAD, the ViewCube is available in the model space viewport (not in paper space or plot windows). AutoCAD also shows a **compass** at the base of the cube if enabled (especially useful in architectural contexts to know the North direction). The compass is a small circular navigator that labels N, E, S, W around the cube’s base. You can click the compass directions as well – for example, clicking “N” on the compass will rotate the view such that the model’s Y-axis (or designated north) aligns to the top of the screen. This effectively just triggers a rotation about the Z-axis to orient the plan view. The compass is mostly relevant if your model has a geospatial orientation (like a building with True North vs Project North in Revit, etc.).

**Usage in AutoCAD:** Typically, an AutoCAD user can use the cube for both navigation and orientation. A common workflow: press and hold left mouse on the ViewCube, drag to do a quick free orbit (with snapping helping square it up), and if an exact view is needed, just click that face. The cube also indicates the current view’s name: if you have a named view or standard view active, hovering the cube often shows the view name. For example, when you are in “SE Isometric”, the cube’s front/top/right faces might be oriented and possibly the name appears. In some Autodesk products, the current view orientation name pops up near the cube.

**Under the hood:** The AutoCAD ViewCube was implemented by Autodesk following research in human factors. The internal logic uses quaternion math for rotations and integrates with the drawing’s UCS (User Coordinate System). Notably, Autodesk holds a **patent (US 7,782,319)** on the ViewCube concept, titled “Three-dimensional orientation indicator and controller.” This patent, granted in 2010, covers the specific interactive mechanism of the cube (such as the combination of selectable cube sections and continuous drag with snapping)[*[52]*](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/16mnl4r/patent_on_autodesk_viewcube/#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20patents%2C,implantation%20and%20want%20to%20use). The existence of this patent means that other companies implementing similar widgets have to be careful not to infringe the exact methods – for instance, Dassault Systèmes likely designed SolidWorks’ View Selector with some differences (like the transient behavior) to steer clear of copying Autodesk’s patented features too directly. That said, the general idea of an orientation cube is not wholly locked down; as one UX designer explained, *“Autodesk hasn’t patented all online 3D viewers, just their specific implementation of a cube widget. You can use the concept as inspiration but avoid an exact copy of their implementation.”[[52]](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/16mnl4r/patent_on_autodesk_viewcube/#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20patents%2C,implantation%20and%20want%20to%20use)*.

In summary, AutoCAD’s ViewCube is a **fully featured orientation gizmo**: always visible, draggable for free orbit (with optional snapping), clickable for direct view selection, with on-cube helpers (arrows, compass, home) to streamline common actions[*[24]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=displayed%20just%20above%20the%20ViewCube,does%20not%20change%20regardless%20of)[[25]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=perspective%2C%20very%20similar%20to%20the,view%20as%20the%20default%20view)*. It significantly aids users in manipulating 3D views and understanding model orientation. The same widget (with minor tweaks) appears in many Autodesk products, so users have a consistent experience across AutoCAD, Inventor, Revit, 3ds Max, Maya (as an option), etc. Next, we will see how Revit’s usage of the ViewCube compares, and then summarize the differences between these implementations.

## Autodesk Revit ViewCube

Autodesk Revit also employs the ViewCube interface, inheriting most of the functionality described for AutoCAD’s ViewCube. In Revit, the ViewCube is displayed in any **3D view** (but not in 2D views like plans or sections). It appears by default in the upper-right corner of a 3D view window and provides the same interactive controls: drag to orbit, click faces to align views, use the home button for default orientation, etc. From a technical standpoint, Revit’s ViewCube is virtually the same underlying control as AutoCAD’s, but its role and some defaults are tuned to architectural use.

**Persistent orientation in 3D views:** In architectural modeling, you often have a concept of *Project North* vs *True North* (one is the “design” orientation of the building in documentation, the other is geo-north). The ViewCube in Revit can help visualize and set these orientations. For example, a common workflow is to rotate a 3D view to an orientation that matches True North and then define that as the “Front” of the cube, so that the cube’s labeled directions correspond to compass directions. Revit allows the user to **redefine which side of the cube is “Front”** by right-clicking the cube and choosing *Set Front to View…[[18]](https://wrw.is/how-to-change-view-on-viewcube-in-revi/#:~:text=How%20to%20change%20the%20%27Front,Current%20View)*. The user can pick the current orientation or even an existing named True North view to assign as the new Front. Once done, the cube’s labels will update accordingly. For instance, one might set the “North” elevation as the Front of the cube – then the cube’s Front face will be labeled “North” (Revit will use the view’s name if it’s an elevation named North, etc.). In practice, out-of-the-box Revit uses default labels Front/Back/Left/Right, but many firms customize the view names to cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) for clarity. The Autodesk forum snippet [*[15]*](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/inventor-ideas/view-cube-rename/idi-p/5418171#:~:text=6,TO%3A%20Show%20the%20Compass) shows an example of desired label customization: changing “Front” to “North”, “Back” to “South”, etc., aligning the cube with GIS directions. By enabling the compass under the cube (via *Show Compass* option), users also get the N-E-S-W indication to avoid confusion[*[15]*](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/inventor-ideas/view-cube-rename/idi-p/5418171#:~:text=6,TO%3A%20Show%20the%20Compass). This is particularly useful in Revit because plan views have a Project North; the ViewCube’s compass will align with Project North by default.

**Navigation and behavior:** When using the cube in Revit, the behavior is much like AutoCAD’s: you can drag the cube to orbit around the model (snapping to closest views if enabled)[*[53]](https://help.autodesk.com/view/NAV/2025/ENU/?guid=GUID-D5C9F81B-C8F9-45B8-A76A-AE5A598702A7#:~:text=Reorient%20the%20View%20of%20a,to%20the%20closest%20preset)[[7]](https://www.autodesk.com/learn/ondemand/tutorial/the-viewcube-in-autocad#:~:text=The%20ViewCube%20in%20AutoCAD%20,click%20the%20ViewCube%20to)*, and click any region to jump to that view. Revit’s default home view is a special *{3D}* view (often an isometric of the whole model). The Home button on the cube resets to that view. Users can redefine the Home view in Revit by positioning the camera as desired, then right-clicking the ViewCube and choosing *“Set current view as Home”*. Revit also respects the *Perspective with Ortho faces* option: Revit has two types of 3D views – Perspective (camera) and Orthographic. If you are in a Perspective 3D view and click an exact face on the cube (say Front), Revit will actually **switch the view out of perspective into an orthographic projection** of that orientation (because a true elevation in Revit cannot be a perspective projection). It essentially creates a temporary orthographic 3D view oriented to that face. If you then orbit away, it might switch back to perspective if that option is configured. This behavior can be a bit confusing for new users (suddenly the projection changes), so some keep that option off, meaning the cube will then just rotate the perspective camera as close as possible to head-on. But by default, Revit tends to keep things orthographic when you go to a standard elevation to mimic how architectural drawings are always orthographic. This is analogous to Inventor’s *Perspective with Ortho faces* mode[*[25]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=perspective%2C%20very%20similar%20to%20the,view%20as%20the%20default%20view) and is intended to give the best of both worlds.

**Differences from AutoCAD’s usage:** One subtle difference is that Revit’s ViewCube is *only active in viewports that are 3D*. In Revit’s UI, you might have multiple view panels (e.g. a plan view, a 3D view, etc. side by side); the cube will appear in the 3D view panel but not in the plan. Also, Revit doesn’t allow some operations that AutoCAD does – for example, you cannot *roll* a 3D view in Revit (Revit has a fixed up-direction for its views). Therefore, the roll arrows on the ViewCube are typically **disabled** or not shown in Revit. Indeed, in Revit if you try to use the roll via keyboard shortcuts, it’s not supported; the cube reflects this by not offering the 90° roll control. The absence of roll arrows is one difference (Inventor and AutoCAD have them, Revit does not). Revit also doesn’t permit continuous upside-down orbit: the *Keep Upright* is essentially always enforced (since the building’s vertical axis is a constant). So the ViewCube in Revit will not let the model go inverted unless you deliberately redefine the up direction.

Another difference is the handling of section box orientation. If you have a section box cutting the model and use the cube to go to a standard view, Revit will align the view to the model axes, not to the section box. (This is a Revit quirk: the cube controls the view’s global orientation, whereas some users expect it to align relative to a section box or scope box – that requires a different method in Revit.) So the cube is strictly world-oriented.

**Customization:** Revit exposes the ViewCube settings in the Options under “View > ViewCube”, very similarly to Inventor. You can choose its size, position, and whether it’s shown. Many Revit users working on documentation hide the cube to maximize screen real estate (especially if they primarily navigate with a 3D mouse or shift-middle-mouse orbit). But for general modeling and navigation, it’s quite useful and thus usually left on. The compass can be toggled (Revit by default shows the compass below the cube labeled with Project North direction).

In summary, Revit’s ViewCube is essentially the same mechanism as AutoCAD’s, with **small differences in default usage**: the emphasis on aligning to building directions, the likely disablement of roll, and integration with Revit’s view types (automatically switching between perspective/ortho if configured). Interaction-wise, a Revit user clicks and drags it the same way. The benefits it provides – quickly going to an elevation or isometric view of the building – are huge for coordination and visualization. For instance, if an architect wants to see the “South façade” of the building model, clicking the corresponding face of the cube (after mapping Front=South) will immediately give that exact orthographic view, which they can then print or use for reference. This saves time compared to manually orbiting or using predefined view shortcuts.

Finally, it’s worth noting that the ViewCube in all Autodesk products receives updates uniformly. By 2024/2025, the ViewCube has become a very polished tool. Autodesk even includes it in their Forge Viewer (a web viewer) for consistency. The ubiquity of the ViewCube’s design across Autodesk’s suite means users moving between AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor, etc., don’t have to relearn orientation controls.

## Comparison of View Cube Implementations in SolidWorks vs AutoCAD vs Revit

The concept of a 3D orientation cube is common to all three applications, but there are important differences in how each one is implemented and used. The table below summarizes key features and behaviors of SolidWorks’ View Selector, Autodesk AutoCAD’s ViewCube, and Autodesk Revit’s ViewCube:

| **Feature / Behavior** | **SolidWorks – View Selector** | **AutoCAD – ViewCube** | **Revit – ViewCube** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Visibility & Activation** | *On-demand transient widget.* Only appears when the user invokes it (Ctrl+Space or via Orientation dialog) and disappears after use[*[35]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Press%20Ctrl%20%2B%20Spacebar%20or,in%20the%20Orientation%20dialog%20box). Not constantly shown on screen (unless pinned in options). | *Always visible* in the 3D modeling viewport (by default). Typically shown in the top-right corner at all times for easy access[*[41]*](https://help.autodesk.com/view/ALIAS/2025/ENU/?guid=Alias_Interface_and_General_Tasks_Viewcube_tools_html#:~:text=Alias%202025%20,isometric%2Forthographic%20views%20of%20your). Can be turned off or moved via settings, but generally persistent. | *Visible in 3D views only.* In a Revit 3D view, the cube is displayed by default in the corner. It is hidden in 2D views (plans/sections). Always on in 3D unless the user hides it in options. |
| **Interaction: Drag (Orbit)** | **No free dragging.** The View Selector is static; you cannot click-drag to continuously orbit. It’s intended for discrete view selection only. The model is orbited by other means (mouse or separate Rotate tool), not by dragging this cube. | **Yes – draggable.** User can click and drag the cube to perform a continuous orbit (Arcball style). During drag, the cube and model rotate in tandem[*[6]*](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MFIA/2025/ENU/?guid=MoldflowInsight_CLC_NewUser_User_Interface_ViewCube_ViewCube_options_html#:~:text=Moldflow%20Insight%20Help%20,one%20of%20the%20fixed). Snapping to axes is active if enabled (view snaps when within ~10° of a standard orientation)[*[8]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=ViewCube%2C%20it%20can%20be%20very,of%20the%20cube%20using%20a). This provides both smooth orbit and auto-align behavior. | **Yes – draggable.** Revit’s cube can also be dragged to orbit the view. It behaves like AutoCAD’s: arcball rotation about the view center, with optional snapping. However, Revit enforces upright orientation (won’t let camera roll upside-down). Dragging is constrained such that the world Z-axis stays roughly up. |
| **Interaction: Click Faces/Edges** | **Click to snap** – primary mode. User hovers and clicks a face, edge, or corner to go to that view. Back faces require Alt key or are auto-exposed by “exploding” out[*[37]](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=the%20View%20Selector%20to%20select,of%20the%20View%20Selector%20cube)[[38]](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Planes%20that%20are%20obscured%20because,select%20without%20rotating%20the%20model)*. Edges and corners represent fixed 45°/isometric views (14 total accessible orientations: 6 faces + 8 corners on front half; back half via Alt). | **Click to snap** – full 26 orientations. Any cube face, edge, or corner can be clicked. Front faces directly selectable; back faces usually accessible by either dragging the cube around or using the on-cube arrows (e.g. click Back triangle or rotate cube) – the cube can also be freely spun to reveal the backside. Edges = 45° intermediate views, corners = isometric views[*[4]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=views%20are%20accessible%29,the%20car%20is%20facing%20the). | **Click to snap** – same 26 orientations as AutoCAD. Back faces can be reached by orbiting the cube (dragging or using compass directions) since Revit’s cube can be rotated. Typically no separate Alt key needed; just drag slightly to access backside or use the compass. Edge and corner clicks function the same as AutoCAD’s (45° and isometric views). |
| **Orientation Feedback** | Highlights hovered face; preview image with view name appears[*[19]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=You%20can%20see%20a%20preview,corner%20of%20the%20preview%20window). Back faces are “ghosted” outward when obscured[*[38]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Planes%20that%20are%20obscured%20because,select%20without%20rotating%20the%20model). No permanent text on cube – faces are blank (no labels printed on them). Users rely on preview text or familiarity for orientation. | Highlights hovered region. Cube faces are labeled with text (or at least letters) like “Top”/“Front”, aiding identification[*[4]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=views%20are%20accessible%29,the%20car%20is%20facing%20the). Outline is dashed during arbitrary rotation and turns solid when precisely aligned to a standard view (snapped)[*[9]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20twenty,closest%20to%20the%20current%20scene). Nearest face is highlighted during orbit to show which view is closest[*[1]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20viewpoints,Furthermore%2C%20the%20%E2%80%95closest%20view%E2%80%96%20feedback). | Same as AutoCAD: face names shown (or user-defined labels like “North”, “East” if configured)[*[16]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Set%20current%20view%20as%20Uses,the%20current%20view%20to%20redefine). Highlighting and outline behaviors are the same. Revit additionally shows a small compass below the cube indicating cardinal directions if enabled, which rotates with the cube[*[15]*](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/inventor-ideas/view-cube-rename/idi-p/5418171#:~:text=6,TO%3A%20Show%20the%20Compass). |
| **Back Side View Selection** | Requires extra step: hold **Alt** to activate back faces[*[37]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=the%20View%20Selector%20to%20select,of%20the%20View%20Selector%20cube). Alternatively, slight delay will “explode” hidden back faces out so you can click them[*[38]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Planes%20that%20are%20obscured%20because,select%20without%20rotating%20the%20model). Because the cube can’t be dragged, this is how SW handles selections on the far side. | Back faces can be accessed by **rotating** the cube (click-drag or flick the cube around) until those faces come into view, or by clicking the compass/arrow that flips to the opposite side. Also, right-clicking the cube has options like “Front” vs “Back” if needed (in some implementations). In practice, dragging is easiest to show the backside. No special key required – the cube is fully 3D interactive. | Same as AutoCAD: user can drag/orbit the cube slightly to bring a back face forward, or use the context menu to directly go to a back view. For example, to see “Back”, you could right-click and choose “Back” or simply spin the cube 180°. Revit doesn’t use Alt for this – Alt in Revit is not needed since the cube isn’t modal. |
| **Snap-to-View Threshold** | Not applicable during drag (no drag support). When hovering near a face, SW does show a preview, but there’s no gradual “snap” – you either click or not. The transition on click is direct to that view (with animation). | **Yes**, configurable. By default, ~10° tolerance: if during a drag orbit your view angle is within 10° of a preset, it auto-snaps to exact. This “Snap to closest view” can be turned off in settings[*[8]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=ViewCube%2C%20it%20can%20be%20very,of%20the%20cube%20using%20a)[[33]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=When%20Dragging%20on%20the%20ViewCube,as%20the%20pivot%20point%20while)*. Snapping makes it easier to land exactly on axes without fiddling. | **Yes**, similar to AutoCAD. In Revit’s options, *Snap to closest* can be enabled or disabled. It functions the same way: as you drag, it will lock the view to top/front/etc. if you come close. Many users keep it on for convenience. |
| **Animation of Transitions** | **Animated rotation** to the new view (default ~0.5s). User can adjust speed or disable animation entirely via a slider in System Options[*[12]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=Image). The animation also includes an “explode” re-centering if needed (back faces coming in). Overall, SW provides a smooth turn to the target view, and preview hovering is instantaneous feedback. | **Animated transition** on click (typically 0.5s spin). Autodesk allows disabling animation (immediate jump) or keeping it. They also have an easing so that the motion helps the user see how the model turns. If the model is extremely large and slow to redraw, the animation might drop frames or can be skipped[*[13]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=current%20pivot%20point%20and%20does,or%20faces%20of%20the%20ViewCube). By default it’s on. | **Animated transition** similarly. Revit’s rotation animations are on by default (with ease-in-out). However, if switching from a perspective to an ortho view, the change might appear abrupt because it changes projection mode. Revit does not expose an option to turn off the animation of the cube (it’s generally always animated). But the animation speed is not user-tunable in Revit UI (it’s fixed short duration). |
| **Maintaining Up/Down Orientation** | Always keeps the model upright in standard views. The View Selector will choose the orientation such that “Up” in the model stays up on screen for faces. (SolidWorks uses Y-axis as default up, so selecting Bottom view will rotate 180° to keep view upright, though this is mostly behind the scenes.) There’s no user toggle for this – it’s implicitly handled. | Has an option “Keep model upright” which is **enabled** by default[*[14]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Note%3A%20When%20navigating%20about%203D,of%20the%20scene%20are%20avoided). This prevents upside-down views. The algorithm will rotate the camera about its viewing axis to orient the scene upright whenever possible on view switches. Users can override by manually rolling or disabling that option. Typically, the cube will never leave you inverted unless you deliberately rotate past 180°. | Always keeps upright (effectively always on). Revit doesn’t allow camera roll via cube, so the building’s vertical stays vertical. There is no UI option to turn off upright enforcement in Revit’s case. So all face views come in right-side-up (e.g. the “South” view will have East on the right, West on the left consistently). |
| **Labels on Faces** | **No text on cube faces.** The cube is blank; view names show in tooltip/preview instead[*[19]*](https://help.solidworks.com/2023/English/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_view_selector.htm#:~:text=You%20can%20see%20a%20preview,corner%20of%20the%20preview%20window). Standard orientations in SolidWorks are named Front/Back/Left/Right/Top/Bottom (and isometric views), which correspond to the cube faces, but the cube itself doesn’t display letters. This was likely to reduce visual clutter on a temporary widget. | **Text labels shown.** The cube faces are typically labeled “Top”, “Front”, etc., or sometimes single letters (depending on UI scale). This is true in AutoCAD, Inventor, etc. It helps identify faces at a glance[*[4]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=views%20are%20accessible%29,the%20car%20is%20facing%20the). The user can redefine which view is “Front” (and thereby what the labels mean) via the context menu (e.g. set the current UCS/view as Front)[*[16]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Set%20current%20view%20as%20Uses,the%20current%20view%20to%20redefine). The compass will show N/S/E/W if enabled, but faces still use the view names. | **Text labels shown, customizable.** By default uses Front/Back/etc., but since in Revit those typically correspond to project cardinal directions, users often redefine them. For instance, you might set “Front” = North elevation[*[18]*](https://wrw.is/how-to-change-view-on-viewcube-in-revi/#:~:text=How%20to%20change%20the%20%27Front,Current%20View), so the cube’s Front face will then read “North”. The UI doesn’t directly let you type custom text, but it inherits the view’s name. So effectively, if your elevation view is named “East”, setting that as Front will make the cube say “East” on that face. Compass label (N) is commonly shown to indicate global north. |
| **Additional UI Elements** | None on the cube itself (no arrows, no home icon on the cube overlay). The Orientation dialog housing the View Selector has separate buttons for standard views and a “Reset Standard Views” if needed. The View Selector does show a *pin icon* in the Orientation window (to keep it open persistently)[*[36]*](http://www.fcsuper.com/swblog/?p=3622#:~:text=Image%3A%20Selecting%20the%20View%20SelectorAnother,launch%20the%20Orientation%20dialog%20box). But on the cube graphic: no roll arrows, no little view direction arrows. SolidWorks instead uses the Alt-key method for back faces and expects users to use keyboard shortcuts or the Orientation menu for other operations (e.g. Normal-To for custom orientations). | **Home icon** (usually above the cube) to reset default view. **Triangular arrows** appear on faces when oriented orthographically, allowing one-click switch to adjacent faces[*[22]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=Switching%20from%20one%20face%20view%2C,We%20replaced%20the%20cones). **Curved arrows** for roll present in upper-right corner of cube[*[47]*](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=5,click%20the%20Home%20View%20icon). **Compass** at base (optional) shows world orientation and can be clicked to rotate view to cardinal directions. The context menu includes many functions (set home, set current as front/top, switch between parallel/perspective, etc.[*[24]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=displayed%20just%20above%20the%20ViewCube,does%20not%20change%20regardless%20of)[[49]](https://inventortutorials.blogspot.com/2012/03/navigation-in-autodesk-inventor_15.html#:~:text=Set%20current%20view%20as%20Home,view%20as%20the%20default%20view)*). Overall, Autodesk’s cube has a richer UI on and around it to minimize additional steps. | **Home icon** is present (click to go to default 3D view). **Compass** is commonly displayed under the cube (especially since Project North matters in Revit) – clicking N on the compass in Revit will rotate the view to face North (which effectively spins the view’s plan rotation). **No roll arrows** (Revit doesn’t support camera roll via cube). **Face indicator triangles** appear just like AutoCAD for quick adjacent view switching. Right-click context menu in Revit’s cube offers: Home, orientation (e.g. Orient to View > Floor Plan or other saved view, a special Revit feature), Set current as Front/Top, and Show/Hide compass, among other options. |

As seen above, SolidWorks’ implementation is simpler and more restricted (no dragging, fewer on-cube controls), focusing on quick selection of views, whereas AutoCAD’s (and Revit’s) ViewCube is a comprehensive orientation and navigation tool that remains on-screen. Revit’s usage aligns with AutoCAD’s with minor tweaks for the building design context.

## Replicating View Cube Functionality in Custom Applications

Implementing a view cube from scratch (or using a game engine/WebGL) involves recreating the core features: a rendered cube in the UI, interactive picking of its faces/edges/corners, and controlling the 3D camera accordingly. Below are recommendations and considerations for building a custom view cube in various environments, along with references to resources:

1. **Use of Existing Libraries or Examples:** Before coding one from scratch, note that several open-source implementations exist which can be leveraged or studied. For example, in the WebGL world, the Three.js community has plugins and examples for view cubes. One notable project is *“Three ViewCube”*, an open-source add-on for Three.js[*[54]*](https://github.com/mlight-lee/three-viewcube#:~:text=ViewCube%20for%20Three). It provides a customizable cube with face labels, adjustable size/position, and integrates with Three.js cameras and orbit controls. The usage is straightforward: you attach the ViewCube to your Three.js camera and renderer, then call an update method each frame to keep it in sync[*[55]](https://github.com/mlight-lee/three-viewcube#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Create%20your%20orbit%20controller,domElement)[[56]](https://github.com/mlight-lee/three-viewcube#:~:text=renderer.clear%28%29%20renderer.render%28scene%2C%20camera%29%20viewCubeGizmo.update%28%29%20)*. The Three.js ViewCube addon allows customizing face texts (for localization or custom labels) and colors via an options object[*[54]](https://github.com/mlight-lee/three-viewcube#:~:text=ViewCube%20for%20Three)[[57]](https://github.com/mlight-lee/three-viewcube#:~:text=hoverColor%3F%3A%20number%20%2F,faceNames%3F%3A%20FaceNames)*. Another community example is Mike M. Lee’s *“Very basic ViewCube”* which demonstrates a simple orientation cube with clickable faces for Three.js[*[58]](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/very-basic-viewcube/14172#:~:text=Just%20wanted%20to%20share%20my,one%20of%20the%20cube%20faces)[[59]](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/very-basic-viewcube/14172#:~:text=html%20overlay%20is%20an%20interesting,onClick%20to%20react%20to%20clicks)*. On the Three.js forum, developers have shared approaches such as using an **HTML/CSS overlay** for the cube (rendering the cube as DOM elements) vs. an **in-scene orthographic camera** to draw the cube in the corner[*[59]*](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/very-basic-viewcube/14172#:~:text=html%20overlay%20is%20an%20interesting,onClick%20to%20react%20to%20clicks). Both approaches can work: an HTML overlay might simplify text labels and mouse event handling (since each face could be a clickable <div>), while a pure WebGL approach might be more integrated with the 3D engine. There’s also an example of using React Three Fiber to render a ViewCube with an orthographic camera view in a corner of the canvas[*[59]*](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/very-basic-viewcube/14172#:~:text=html%20overlay%20is%20an%20interesting,onClick%20to%20react%20to%20clicks). These references can jump-start development.

For other frameworks: in the Rust Bevy game engine, a developer created a *bevy_viewcube* plugin (code on GitHub) after live-streaming the process[*[60]*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bevy/comments/13387b9/any_example_of_autocad_viewcube/#:~:text=PhaestusFox%20%20%E2%80%A2%20%20upvotes,%E2%80%A2%202y%20ago). They mention that they “brute forced” the rotations for each cube face/corner, which implies they manually coded the orientation quaternions for all 26 views (a valid approach to ensure accuracy)[*[26]*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bevy/comments/13387b9/any_example_of_autocad_viewcube/#:~:text=I%20thought%20this%20was%20a,rotation%20on%20click%20in%20bevy). Studying such examples can provide insights into handling input events and camera tweening. In summary, **existing open-source clones or code**: Three.js ViewCube addon[*[54]*](https://github.com/mlight-lee/three-viewcube#:~:text=ViewCube%20for%20Three), Bevy’s example[*[60]*](https://www.reddit.com/r/bevy/comments/13387b9/any_example_of_autocad_viewcube/#:~:text=PhaestusFox%20%20%E2%80%A2%20%20upvotes,%E2%80%A2%202y%20ago), and others from the three.js forum and GitHub (there are multiple, including one for React, one for plain three.js, etc., and even one integrated in Autodesk’s Forge viewer).

1. **Rendering the Cube UI:** Typically, one would render the cube in a **second viewport or layer** so that it appears on top of the main scene. For instance, in OpenGL or DirectX, you can do this by rendering the main scene, then switching to an orthographic projection and rendering a lit cube at a fixed screen-aligned position (e.g. top-right corner). You’d likely disable depth testing or clear the depth buffer before drawing the cube so that it isn’t occluded by the main scene[*[59]*](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/very-basic-viewcube/14172#:~:text=html%20overlay%20is%20an%20interesting,onClick%20to%20react%20to%20clicks). The cube can be a simple cube mesh. Each face can be given a distinct ID or color for picking. For example, one technique is **color picking**: render the cube in an offscreen buffer with each face shaded in a unique flat color (each color corresponds to a face/edge/corner ID), then on a mouse click, read the pixel color under the cursor to determine which part was clicked. However, since edges and corners are smaller regions, you might prefer a geometry-based picking: subdivide the cube’s mesh so that each selectable region is a separate polygon (or group of polygons). For instance, you can split each edge into two triangular buttons (for roll arrows if implementing), and possibly split corners if needed. In practice, it may be easier to treat faces and corners as separate invisible buttons. Many implementations ignore “exact edge” clicks and just allow faces and corners (since an edge click could be interpreted as one of the two adjacent face views). Autodesk’s design actually doesn’t have distinct “edge view” buttons in the original Glass Cube; they used edges for roll only[*[61]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=selected%20,The%20Glass%20Cube%20fills%20a)[[62]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=clicking%20on%20a%20cube%20edge,and%20selecting%20the%20Glass%20Cube)*. But the ViewCube as shipped does count edge orientations as views. A simpler approach: if a user clicks near an edge, decide programmatically whether to go to the closest face or a corner. It might suffice to only explicitly handle faces and corners as separate picks, and infer edge clicks by exclusion.

In engines like **Unity or Unreal**, you can implement a view cube by using a **second camera** that renders a cube model. For Unity, one approach is: create a small cube model in the scene, parent it to the main camera (so it rotates with the camera’s orientation, always representing the world axes relative to camera). Then have a second camera render this cube. You’d set the second camera to orthographic and layer the cube on a UI layer so that it appears as an overlay in the corner of the screen. Unity’s Scene view orientation gizmo (in the Editor) is not directly available at runtime, but you can mimic it. Unity’s forum has discussions where users suggested using Handles (editor-only) or the separate camera trick for runtime[*[63]*](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/202893/when-device-is-put-in-landscape-mode-a-cube-in-the-corner-of-the-screen-no-long#:~:text=unity%20,is%20closer%20to%20the%20cube). The separate camera method gives you a texture or overlay for the cube. You’d then handle input on that rendered image: Unity’s UI system could capture clicks on the RenderTexture area, and you convert that to a ray to intersect the cube. Alternatively, simply cast a ray from the mouse into the cube object (since it’s parented to camera, it will always be at a known screen position). In Unreal Engine, one could similarly use a 3D Widget or a small cube mesh attached to a *SceneCaptureComponent2D* (to render to a UI widget). The high-level idea is consistent: **render a manipulable cube in screen-space coordinates** and map user interactions to camera transforms.

1. **Camera Control and Snapping:** For the camera/orientation logic, you’ll implement two modes: *free orbit* (if dragging) and *discrete jumps* (if clicking). For free orbit, using the well-known **Arcball algorithm** is recommended for a smooth, intuitive rotation. The Arcball (by Shoemake 1992) maps 2D mouse drags to rotations on a virtual sphere[*[31]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L776%20SHOEMAKE%2C%20K,Visualizing%203D%20Scenes). Many libraries have this in their trackball/orbit controls. If you already have an orbit control (like Three.js’s OrbitControls or a game engine’s camera controller), you can tie into that. For example, in Three.js, the ViewCube addon simply listens for camera changes and updates its orientation, and on cube click it calls the orbit control to rotate to a preset angle[*[64]](https://docs.thatopen.com/Tutorials/UserInterface/OBC/ViewCube#:~:text=You%20can%20let%20users%20click,the%20left%20face%20is%20clicked)[[65]](https://docs.thatopen.com/Tutorials/UserInterface/OBC/ViewCube#:~:text=viewCube.addEventListener%28%22back%22%2C%20%28%29%20%3D%3E%20%7B%20world.camera.controls.setLookAt%28,)*. You could do similarly: when a face is clicked, compute the target camera orientation (either as target Euler angles or quaternion), then animate the camera towards it. Animating can be done with a simple interpolation over a short time with ease-out.

For *snapping* during drag, you’ll need to constantly check the current camera orientation. A simple approach: maintain a list of quaternion orientations for all the main views (and perhaps their names). Every frame during a drag, compute the angular difference between the camera’s current rotation and each of those reference rotations. If any difference is below your threshold (say 10°), then you can either: (a) snap immediately (lock the camera to that orientation and perhaps pause further rotation until the user moves significantly again), or (b) just highlight it (like show a visual cue) and only snap fully when the drag ends near that orientation. Autodesk’s implementation appears to snap *during* the drag (the cube face “sticks” as you drag past the threshold)[*[8]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=ViewCube%2C%20it%20can%20be%20very,of%20the%20cube%20using%20a)[[9]](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20twenty,closest%20to%20the%20current%20scene)*. You can replicate that by essentially clamping the rotation to the nearest axis once within epsilon. Another technique is *inertia with snapping*: let the user orbit freely but on mouse-up, if the final orientation is within threshold of a standard view, then smoothly tween the rest of the way to that standard view. This way, the snap occurs at the end of the drag rather than mid-drag. The appropriate method might depend on user preference; Autodesk chose snap-and-go during drag for immediacy[*[8]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=ViewCube%2C%20it%20can%20be%20very,of%20the%20cube%20using%20a), but some implementations might choose end-of-drag snapping to avoid jarring jumps mid-rotation. In either case, providing a visual indicator (like changing the cube outline to solid when in snap range) is a good UX practice[*[9]*](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/viewcube-a-3d-orientation.pdf_recsg8BsEjf1BeIbZ.pdf#:~:text=fixed%20twenty,closest%20to%20the%20current%20scene).

1. **Face label rendering:** If you want labels (like “Top”, “Front”) on the cube faces, you have a few options. In a WebGL or OpenGL context, you can texture the faces with text images. For instance, create a small PNG for each face with the word, and map it onto the cube’s material. This is easy but yields static labels (localization or dynamic renaming would require regenerating textures). Another way is to use a text rendering in 3D – e.g. in Three.js, one could use TextGeometry to actually put 3D letters on the cube. But that adds geometry and complexity (and potentially the letters also need to rotate to always face outward). A simpler method: use screen-aligned 2D text drawn near the cube. Some implementations forego text entirely and instead might color-code faces or rely on an external legend. However, text labels greatly help usability. The open-source Three.js ViewCube allows passing in custom face names and handles drawing them (likely by painting text onto a canvas texture for each face)[*[66]](https://github.com/mlight-lee/three-viewcube#:~:text=,Font%20size%20of%20the%20faceNames)[[67]](https://github.com/mlight-lee/three-viewcube#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Create%20you%20camera%20and,render)*. That is a good reference on how to do it in code.
2. **Camera “Home” and resets:** You might want to include a “Home” view that the user can set. This could be as simple as storing a default orientation and position for the camera. Implement a small home icon button in UI (or detect double-click on the cube maybe) to reset. In some implementations, clicking the cube’s background (not on a face) could reset to home. In Autodesk’s, it’s a separate icon.
3. **Integration with Existing Controls:** If your application already has other view controls (keyboard shortcuts for views, or mouse drag to orbit), ensure the view cube updates in sync. Typically, you’ll have the cube’s orientation tied to the camera transform. For example, each frame or upon camera change, set the cube object’s rotation = camera’s rotation (inverse, depending on coordinate system). In many setups, the cube is conceptually showing the world axes relative to camera. If the camera rotates, you apply the same rotation to the cube so that its faces still represent world directions. In practice, if using a second camera to render the cube, you might simply copy the main camera’s rotation to the cube (or better, use the inverse rotation so that when the camera looks, say, north, the cube’s “North” face faces the screen). Getting this right might require a few trials – but since the cube is typically aligned such that when you are in a standard view, the corresponding face text is facing the user, you can verify by testing a known orientation (e.g. point camera to +X (East) and ensure the cube’s “East” or right face is toward viewer).
4. **Legal and Design Considerations:** As mentioned, Autodesk has a patent on the specific ViewCube design. If you are implementing it for a commercial product, you may want to introduce some differences to avoid infringement. For instance, you could choose a different shape (some have proposed a sphere or a pyramid, though those are less intuitive). The Reddit discussion[*[52]*](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/16mnl4r/patent_on_autodesk_viewcube/#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20patents%2C,implantation%20and%20want%20to%20use) suggests that as long as you don’t copy *every* aspect exactly, you should be clear – many apps have similar widgets with small variations. Some possible variations: not including the on-cube roll arrows (or using a different UI for that), requiring a modifier for certain actions (as SolidWorks does for back faces), or styling the widget differently (colors, etc.). Functionally, the basics (faces to standard views) are common in many tools, so it’s unlikely to be an issue, but it’s good to be aware.
5. **Example Pseudocode:** Below is a very simplified pseudocode outline for handling a cube face click in a WebGL-like environment:

// Assume we have predefined orientations as quaternions or rotation matrices:

orientations = {

"front": quatFromEuler(0, 0, 0),

"back": quatFromEuler(0, 180, 0),

"left": quatFromEuler(0, -90, 0),

"right": quatFromEuler(0, 90, 0),

"top": quatFromEuler(-90, 0, 0),

"bottom": quatFromEuler(90, 0, 0),

// ... and similarly for corners like "front_top_right": quat(...).

};

// When a user clicks on the cube:

function onCubeClicked(region) {

targetOrientation = orientations[region];  // e.g. "front", "front_top_right", etc.

// Animate camera.rotation from currentOrientation to targetOrientation

animateCameraRotation(camera.quaternion, targetOrientation, duration=0.5);

// Optionally, if Fit-to-view is desired:

if (fitToViewOnChange) camera.zoomToFitScene();

}

For dragging, one could implement onMouseDrag on the cube:

function onCubeDrag(deltaX, deltaY) {

// Map pixel drag to rotation angles

let rotX = deltaY * rotationSpeed; // vertical drag -> pitch

let rotY = deltaX * rotationSpeed; // horizontal drag -> yaw

camera.orbit(rotX, rotY);

// If snapping enabled:

if (snapEnabled) {

for (let [name, quat] of Object.entries(orientations)) {

let angle = camera.quaternion.angularDistanceTo(quat);

if (angle < snapThreshold) {

camera.quaternion = quat;  // snap to exact

// Provide feedback - e.g., highlight that face on cube

cube.highlightFace(name);

break;

}

}

}

}

This pseudocode omits many details (like ensuring the rotation is about the correct pivot point, handling roll, etc.), but gives an idea. In practice, you’d likely use existing math utilities for quaternions and perhaps incorporate an inertia or smoothing for continuous drag.

It discusses user studies comparing arcball dragging vs. clicking vs. traditional view lists, and it explains features like the dashed/solid outlines and the reasoning for 26 view buttons. For coding, exploring the source of the three.js addon or forum examples is very instructive – e.g., the Three.js ViewCube demo on CodeSandbox[*[59]*](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/very-basic-viewcube/14172#:~:text=html%20overlay%20is%20an%20interesting,onClick%20to%20react%20to%20clicks) or the GitHub repository which shows how they handle attaching the cube to the renderer and listening for click events[*[55]](https://github.com/mlight-lee/three-viewcube#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Create%20your%20orbit%20controller,domElement)[[68]](https://github.com/mlight-lee/three-viewcube#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20rotate,ViewCubeGizmo)*. If using Unity, the Unity forums (Unity Answers) have threads like “How to create navigation/orientation cube”[*[69]*](https://discussions.unity.com/t/how-to-create-navigation-orientation-cube/949496#:~:text=How%20to%20create%20navigation%2Forientation%20cube,and%20aren%27t%20affected%20by%20lighting) where developers suggest using OnPostRender to draw a cube or using a second camera (StackExchange post suggests separate camera for the widget[*[63]*](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/202893/when-device-is-put-in-landscape-mode-a-cube-in-the-corner-of-the-screen-no-long#:~:text=unity%20,is%20closer%20to%20the%20cube)).

In conclusion, reimplementing a ViewCube involves combining **graphics (cube rendering)** and **interaction (camera control)**. Breaking it into parts: draw the cube (with labels), map clicks to known orientations (and animate the camera), implement dragging (with arcball math and optional snapping), and polish with visual cues. By studying existing implementations and using engine-specific tools (like UI overlays or multiple cameras), one can create a custom view cube in WebGL, OpenGL, DirectX, or any engine like Unity/Unreal. The end result greatly enhances 3D navigation, giving users an intuitive handle to orient the scene, much like in professional CAD software.
