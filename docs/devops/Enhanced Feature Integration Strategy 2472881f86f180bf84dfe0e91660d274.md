# Enhanced Feature Integration Strategy

# üéØ **Enhanced Feature Integration Strategy**

## SizeWise¬†Suite¬†‚Äì Refactored Snap¬†Logic Integration

**Version**:¬†3.0.0‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ**Prepared**:¬†2025‚Äë08‚Äë06‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ**Review Date**:¬†2025‚Äë08‚Äë20

**Audience**: Engineering, QA, Product, Documentation

**Scope**: Detailed integration plan for each SizeWise¬†Suite feature with the refactored snap logic architecture, including tier gating, standards compliance, accessibility and offline‚Äëfirst support, QA mapping, and documentation synchronization.

### üìñ Purpose

This enhanced strategy expands upon the original feature integration document by providing atomic‚Äëlevel tasks, explicit integration points, dependency mapping, and remediation actions for each feature. It ensures that the refactored snap logic is seamlessly adopted across all SizeWise features while meeting regulatory standards (SMACNA/ASHRAE/NFPA), accessibility (WCAG¬†2.1¬†AA), and offline‚Äëfirst PWA requirements[[1]](https://btrained.net/hvac-articles/understanding-smacna-standards-for-hvac-duct-fabrication#:~:text=SMACNA%20categorizes%20ducts%20based%20on,The%20main%20classifications%20include)[[2]](https://accessibleweb.com/rating/aa/#:~:text=Double,of%C2%A0users%20with%20a%20reasonable%20budget)[[3]](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/caching#:~:text=What%20to%20cache).

## üì¶ Feature‚Äëby‚ÄëFeature Integration Plan

For each feature we outline its current state, integration tasks, dependencies, tier gating, compliance checkpoints, QA mapping, and definition of done.

### 1. üå¨Ô∏è Air¬†Duct¬†Sizing Calculations

### Current Implementation

- Tight coupling between duct sizing logic and snap detection.
- Manual calculation triggers without real‚Äëtime feedback.
- Limited validation; no enforcement of SMACNA standards.
- Performance bottlenecks with complex layouts.

### Integration Goals

1. Decouple sizing logic from snap detection by injecting services via DI container.
2. Validate duct paths with snap detection and SMACNA rules before calculation.
3. Provide automatic real‚Äëtime sizing updates on drawing changes.
4. Implement SMACNA compliance reporting and error suggestions.[[1]](https://btrained.net/hvac-articles/understanding-smacna-standards-for-hvac-duct-fabrication#:~:text=SMACNA%20categorizes%20ducts%20based%20on,The%20main%20classifications%20include)

### Atomic Tasks & File‚Äëlevel Integration

| Task | File/Module | Description | Dependencies | QA/Test Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inject sizing service | `src/services/AirDuctSizingService.ts` | Refactor existing sizing logic into a class that accepts `SnapDetectionService`, `DrawingService`, `ConfigurationService`, and `CalculationEngine` via constructor. Register in DI container. | DI container, SnapDetectionService | Unit test `AirDuctSizingService.test.ts` ensures dependencies are injected correctly. |
| Validate duct path | `src/services/AirDuctSizingService.ts` | Add method `validateDuctPath(path)` that uses `SnapDetectionService.findClosestSnapPoint()` to validate connections and collects suggestions. | SnapDetectionService | Test `validateDuctPath.test.ts` checks suggestions when unsnapped points encountered. |
| Apply SMACNA standards | `src/services/AirDuctSizingService.ts`, `src/services/SMACNAValidator.ts` | Before performing calculations, call `SMACNAValidator.validateCenterline()` to ensure gauge thickness, reinforcement, and pressure classes meet SMACNA guidelines[[1]](https://btrained.net/hvac-articles/understanding-smacna-standards-for-hvac-duct-fabrication#:~:text=SMACNA%20categorizes%20ducts%20based%20on,The%20main%20classifications%20include). Use configuration service defaults for unspecified parameters. | SMACNAValidator | Test `AirDuctSizingService.smacna.test.ts` verifies that invalid ducts produce warnings. |
| Automatic updates | `src/components/AirDuctSizingPanel.tsx`, `src/services/EventBus.ts` | Subscribe to `centerline_updated` events; call `calculateDuctSizing()` for affected paths. Debounce to avoid thrashing. | EventBus, DrawingService | Integration test `AirDuctSizingPanel.integration.test.tsx` ensures updates occur within 200¬†ms of drawing modifications. |
| Tier gating | `src/components/AirDuctSizingPanel.tsx`, `src/hooks/useAccountTier.ts` | If the user is on Free tier, hide advanced options (custom materials, batch sizing). Use `useAccountTier()` hook to determine tier. | Account tier service | Test `AirDuctSizingPanel.tier.test.tsx` verifies gating. |
| SMACNA report generation | `src/services/EngineeringReportsService.ts` | For each sizing calculation, produce a compliance report summarizing errors/warnings, including reinforcement spacing, material thickness, and pressure class classification[[1]](https://btrained.net/hvac-articles/understanding-smacna-standards-for-hvac-duct-fabrication#:~:text=SMACNA%20categorizes%20ducts%20based%20on,The%20main%20classifications%20include). | SMACNAValidator, Report generator | Test `EngineeringReportsService.test.ts` ensures report contains expected sections. |
| Export metadata | `src/services/EnhancedVanPackerExport.ts` | Include sizing results, SMACNA validation results, and snap point metadata in export payload. Offer `validateBeforeExport` option. | AirDuctSizingService, SMACNAValidator | Integration test `VanPackerExport.integration.test.ts` verifies payload structure. |

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Cross‚ÄëTeam Handoff & Responsibilities

To eliminate ambiguity, this strategy defines responsibilities at each stage:

| Role | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Product Owner** | Prioritize features, approve requirements, decide tier gating. Provide clarifications during development. Review final demo. |
| **Engineering Lead** | Decompose tasks, assign to developers, ensure coding standards. Maintain DI container and configuration schema. Ensure compliance with SMACNA/ASHRAE/NFPA standards and accessibility guidelines. |
| **Developers** | Implement tasks exactly as specified, update tests, update docs. Collaborate with QA early to define test cases. |
| **QA Engineers** | Write and maintain test cases for each feature. Perform regression, performance, accessibility and offline tests. Validate tier gating. Sign off on acceptance criteria. |
| **Technical Writer** | Update documentation and user guides. Ensure docs reflect changes and include compliance citations. Monitor documentation triggers. |
| **DevOps / Build Engineer** | Maintain CI scripts, performance baselines, documentation checks. Implement rollback and migration scripts. |

## üìö Documentation & Synchronization

All integrations must reference the canonical markdown documents (e.g., `logic-validators.md`, `smacna-guide.md`). Documentation updates are triggered whenever public APIs or UI change. The `docs/CHANGELOG.md` must record the feature integration version. The doc owner must ensure that cross‚Äëreferences are updated and that any conflicts with other documents are recorded in `docs/discrepancies.md`.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This enhanced feature integration strategy transforms the high‚Äëlevel recommendations into actionable, atomic tasks with clear dependencies, tier gating, compliance checkpoints, and quality gates. By following this plan, the SizeWise¬†Suite will integrate the refactored snap logic architecture seamlessly while maintaining standards compliance and accessibility, delivering a performant and user‚Äëfriendly experience.
