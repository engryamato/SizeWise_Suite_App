# 🌳 Branch Management Strategy - SizeWise Suite App

## 📊 **Current State Analysis**

**Repository Health**: ⚠️ **NEEDS CLEANUP**
- **Total Branches**: 47 (6 local, 41 remote)
- **Open Pull Requests**: 18
- **Stale Branches**: 23 (older than 2 weeks)
- **Dependabot Branches**: 12
- **Documentation PRs**: 10 (needs consolidation)

## 🎯 **Branch Management Goals**

1. **Reduce branch sprawl** from 47 to <20 active branches
2. **Implement consistent naming conventions**
3. **Automate cleanup processes**
4. **Improve development workflow efficiency**
5. **Maintain clean repository history**

## 📋 **Branch Categories & Naming Conventions**

### **🔧 Feature Development**
```
feature/short-description
feat/short-description
```
**Examples**: `feature/pwa-integration`, `feat/air-duct-calculator`

### **🐛 Bug Fixes**
```
fix/issue-description
bugfix/issue-number
hotfix/critical-issue
```
**Examples**: `fix/security-logging`, `bugfix/package-json-error`

### **📚 Documentation**
```
docs/topic-description
documentation/section-name
```
**Examples**: `docs/api-reference`, `docs/installation-guide`

### **🧹 Maintenance**
```
chore/task-description
refactor/component-name
cleanup/area-name
```
**Examples**: `chore/remove-unused-deps`, `refactor/auth-service`

### **🧪 Testing & CI/CD**
```
test/test-type
ci/pipeline-improvement
```
**Examples**: `test/e2e-coverage`, `ci/docker-optimization`

### **🚀 Releases**
```
release/version-number
release-prep/version-number
```
**Examples**: `release/v1.2.0`, `release-prep/v1.2.0`

## 🔄 **Branch Lifecycle Management**

### **Phase 1: Creation**
```bash
# Always branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Push and create PR early
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
gh pr create --draft --title "WIP: New Feature"
```

### **Phase 2: Development**
```bash
# Regular commits with conventional commit messages
git commit -m "feat: add new feature component"
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for feature"
git commit -m "docs: update feature documentation"

# Keep branch up to date
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

### **Phase 3: Review & Merge**
```bash
# Mark PR as ready for review
gh pr ready

# After approval and CI/CD success
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

### **Phase 4: Cleanup**
```bash
# Automatic cleanup after merge
# Local cleanup
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/new-feature
```

## 🧹 **Automated Cleanup Rules**

### **Daily Cleanup (Automated)**
- Delete branches merged into main
- Update local repository with `git fetch --prune`
- Clean up local tracking branches

### **Weekly Cleanup (Semi-Automated)**
- Identify stale branches (>1 week, no activity)
- Flag branches behind main by >10 commits
- Consolidate related documentation PRs

### **Monthly Cleanup (Manual Review)**
- Archive important but inactive branches
- Delete stale branches (>2 weeks, no PR)
- Review and merge long-running feature branches

## 📊 **Branch Health Metrics**

### **Green Indicators** ✅
- <20 total active branches
- <5 open PRs per developer
- All branches <1 week old or have active PRs
- <3 commits behind main

### **Yellow Indicators** ⚠️
- 20-30 total branches
- 5-10 open PRs per developer
- Branches 1-2 weeks old without PRs
- 3-10 commits behind main

### **Red Indicators** 🔴
- >30 total branches
- >10 open PRs per developer
- Branches >2 weeks old without PRs
- >10 commits behind main

## 🛠️ **Implementation Plan**

### **Week 1: Critical Cleanup**
```bash
# Execute Phase 1 cleanup
./scripts/branch-cleanup-phase1.sh

# Merge critical branches
# - test/ci-cd-pipeline-verification
# - alert-autofix-87
# Delete merged branches
# - fix/package-json
# - chore/remove-superadmin
```

### **Week 2: Review & Consolidation**
```bash
# Execute Phase 2 review
./scripts/branch-cleanup-phase2.sh

# Review active feature branches
# Consolidate documentation PRs
# Batch merge Dependabot updates
```

### **Week 3: Stale Branch Cleanup**
```bash
# Execute Phase 3 cleanup
./scripts/branch-cleanup-phase3.sh

# Archive important branches
# Delete stale branches
# Clean up merged Dependabot branches
```

### **Week 4: Process Implementation**
- Set up automated cleanup workflows
- Document branch naming conventions
- Train team on new processes
- Implement branch health monitoring

## 🔧 **Automation Setup**

### **GitHub Actions Workflow**
```yaml
name: Branch Cleanup
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday at 2 AM
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Delete merged branches
        run: |
          git branch -r --merged main | 
          grep -v main | 
          sed 's/origin\///' | 
          xargs -n 1 git push origin --delete
```

### **Branch Protection Rules**
- Require PR reviews before merge
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Automatically delete head branches after merge

## 📋 **Team Guidelines**

### **Do's** ✅
- Use descriptive branch names
- Create PRs early (as drafts)
- Keep branches small and focused
- Rebase regularly to stay current
- Delete branches after merge

### **Don'ts** ❌
- Don't create long-running feature branches
- Don't push directly to main
- Don't leave stale branches
- Don't use generic names like "fix" or "update"
- Don't merge without CI/CD passing

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **Target Metrics (3 months)**
- **Branch Count**: <15 active branches
- **PR Cycle Time**: <3 days average
- **Stale Branches**: 0
- **CI/CD Success Rate**: >95%
- **Merge Conflicts**: <5% of PRs

### **Monitoring Dashboard**
- Weekly branch health reports
