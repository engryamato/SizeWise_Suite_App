## Review Guidelines

### For Authors

**Before Requesting Review**:
```bash
# Self-review checklist
git diff main...HEAD  # Review all changes
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run lint          # Check code style
npm run build         # Verify build works
```

**Writing Good PR Descriptions**:
- Explain the "why" behind changes
- Highlight areas that need special attention
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Link to related issues or documentation

**Responding to Feedback**:
- Address all comments, even if just to acknowledge
- Ask for clarification when feedback is unclear
- Push back respectfully when you disagree
- Thank reviewers for their time and insights

### For Reviewers

**Review Priorities** (in order):
1. **Correctness**: Does the code work as intended?
2. **Security**: Are there security vulnerabilities?
3. **Performance**: Will this impact system performance?
4. **Maintainability**: Is the code easy to understand and modify?
5. **Style**: Does it follow coding conventions?

**Providing Effective Feedback**:
```
❌ Bad: "This is wrong"
✅ Good: "This function doesn't handle null values. Consider adding a null check or using optional chaining."

❌ Bad: "Use better variable names"
✅ Good: "Consider renaming 'data' to 'calculationResults' for clarity"

❌ Bad: "This won't work"
✅ Good: "This approach might cause issues with concurrent requests. Have you considered using a lock or queue?"
```

**Review Comment Types**:
- **🚨 Blocking**: Must be fixed before merge
- **💡 Suggestion**: Recommended improvement
- **❓ Question**: Seeking clarification
- **🎨 Style**: Minor style/formatting issue
- **👍 Praise**: Acknowledge good work

### Review Etiquette

**Do's**:
- Be respectful and constructive
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good code and clever solutions
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Be specific and actionable in feedback

**Don'ts**:
- Don't be overly critical or harsh
