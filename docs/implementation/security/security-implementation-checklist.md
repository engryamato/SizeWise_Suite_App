- Examples: Repeated failed authentications, suspicious patterns

**Level 3: High Severity**
- Log event, temporary account lock, admin notification
- Examples: Multiple tier bypass attempts, unusual data access

**Level 4: Critical Severity**
- Emergency shutdown, immediate admin alert, forensic logging
- Examples: License tampering, database corruption, feature flag bypass

### Security Incident Documentation ✅

- [ ] **Affected users and data**
- [ ] **Attack vector and method**
- [ ] **Response actions taken**
- [ ] **Lessons learned and improvements**

## Security Implementation Dependencies ✅

### Phase 1 Dependencies (Offline)
```
License Validation → Feature Flag Security → Tier Enforcement
Database Encryption → Data Integrity → Secure Storage
Authentication → Session Management → User Security
Security Logging → Threat Detection → Incident Response
```

### Phase 2 Dependencies (SaaS)
```
Phase 1 Security → Cloud Authentication → Multi-Tenant Security
TLS/Certificate Pinning → API Security → Data Protection
RBAC → Organization Security → Compliance Logging
```

### Critical Path Items ✅
1. **License validation MUST be implemented first** - Foundation for all tier enforcement
2. **Database encryption MUST be active before any data storage** - Protects all user data
3. **Feature flag security MUST be implemented before tier features** - Prevents bypass attempts
4. **Security logging MUST be active from first application launch** - Enables threat detection

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Security implementation checklist with validation criteria  
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1.5 Security Implementation before any tier enforcement work

**⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER**: NO TIER ENFORCEMENT IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL ALL PHASE 1 SECURITY MEASURES ARE COMPLETE AND VALIDATED
