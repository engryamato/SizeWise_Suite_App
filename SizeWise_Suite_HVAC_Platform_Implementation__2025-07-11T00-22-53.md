[ ] NAME:Current Task List DESCRIPTION:Root task for conversation __NEW_AGENT__
-[x] NAME:Please analyze the current codebase to determine if you have sufficient information and documentation to start the application. Specifically: DESCRIPTION:1. First, examine the project structure and identify the main application entry points, configuration files, and dependencies 2. Check for existing documentation (README files, setup instructions, package.json scripts, etc.) that explains how to start the application 3. Identify any missing dependencies, environment variables, or configuration that would be required to run the app 4. Verify if there are any build steps, database setup, or other prerequisites needed  If you determine that you have complete information to start the app, create a comprehensive task breakdown that includes: - All prerequisite setup steps (dependency installation, environment configuration, database setup, etc.) - The specific commands or processes needed to start the application - Any verification steps to confirm the app is running correctly - Identification of potential issues or troubleshooting steps  If you find that information is missing or unclear, specify exactly what additional documentation or clarification is needed before proceeding with the startup process.
-[x] NAME:Analysis Complete - SizeWise Suite Project Initialization Required DESCRIPTION:Based on the analysis, the SizeWise Suite workspace is currently empty except for documentation and Augment configuration files. The project needs to be initialized from scratch. SizeWise Suite is a modular HVAC engineering platform with multiple modules (Air Duct Sizer, Grease Duct Sizer, Engine Exhaust Sizer, Boiler Vent Sizer, and Estimating App). No application code, dependencies, or build configuration exists yet.
-[x] NAME:Clarify Project Initialization Requirements DESCRIPTION:Since no application code exists, we need clarification on: 1) Which technology stack to use (React/Next.js, Vue, Angular, etc.), 2) Which modules to implement first, 3) Whether to start with a specific module or create the overall platform structure, 4) Database requirements (if any), 5) Deployment target (web app, desktop app, etc.). The documentation shows this is an offline-first HVAC engineering platform but doesn't specify the technical implementation approach.

--[x] NAME:Verify Application Startup and Functionality DESCRIPTION:Test the complete application stack, verify offline functionality, validate Air Duct Sizer calculations, ensure PWA installation works, and confirm all components integrate properly.
-[x] NAME:Use this answer from chatgpt: DESCRIPTION:Let's scrutinize your summary and the follow-up questions, line by line, as a technical reviewer and project architect:  ---  ## **What SizeWise Suite Is**  ### **Your Claims:**  > 1. *A modular, offline-capable HVAC engineering and estimating platform* > 2. *Designed to unify duct sizing, vent design, and cost estimating in a single workspace* > 3. *Target users: Mechanical engineers, estimators, QA professionals, and project managers* > 4. *Core modules planned: Air Duct Sizer, Grease Duct Sizer, Engine Exhaust Sizer, Boiler Vent Sizer, and Estimating App* > 5. *Key features: Standards compliance (SMACNA, NFPA, ASHRAE), offline-first design, bidirectional unit conversion (Imperial/SI)*  ---  ### **Validation & Corrections:**  1. **TRUE:**     * *Modular, offline-capable HVAC engineering and estimating platform* matches your documentation, directory structure, and offline-first requirements.  2. **TRUE:**     * *Unified sizing, venting, estimating in one workspace* is the explicit architectural goal (modular but shared workspace/dashboard).  3. **TRUE, but can clarify:**     * Target users are indeed mechanical engineers, estimators, QA, and PMs—add *contractors* if you expect them to use the estimating features directly, but not required.  4. **TRUE:**     * Your folder structure and docs list these core modules.  5. **TRUE:**     * Standards compliance, offline-first, and Imperial/SI unit support are all explicitly required and are part of your real implementation plans.  ---  ## **Missing Information for Startup**  > *Since no application exists yet, we need clarification on several key decisions before proceeding:*  Let's examine each item:  ### **A. Technology Stack**  * **Your claim:** Framework choice (React/Next.js, Vue, Angular, desktop, etc.) is undecided. * **Correction:**    * *You have already decided on*:      * **Backend:** Python (Flask)     * **Frontend:** Modular JavaScript (offline-first, upgradable to React or TypeScript)     * **Docs:** MkDocs + Sphinx   * *You have NOT committed* to a full SPA (React, Vue, Angular) **yet**, but structure is compatible.   * *Desktop app* is a future/possible deployment, not the first target.  ### **B. Implementation Priority**  * **Your claim:** Need to pick which module/foundation to start. * **Correction:**    * *You have already launched the first phase as Air Duct Sizer (Phase 0.1)* and have a file/folder structure and documentation process in place.   * Foundation is being built in parallel with module delivery (shared `/core/`, `/services/`, etc.).  ### **C. Database Requirements**  * **Your claim:** Data storage solution is undecided. * **Correction:**    * *No server DB is required for offline-first operation*, but a local (IndexedDB, SQLite, JSON) store is needed for offline web or Electron desktop.   * *Cloud/central DB* is a future option (for multi-user sync, account-based features, etc.), but not initial MVP.  ### **D. Deployment Target**  * **Your claim:** Not yet decided (web, desktop, both). * **Correction:**    * *Your MVP target is a web application with strong offline capabilities* (PWA or local-first approach).   * Desktop (via Electron or similar) is a future/optional deployment—structure supports both, but web is the first goal.  ### **E. Development Approach**  * **Your claim:** Unclear if you’re following a specific architecture. * **Correction:**    * *You have committed to a modular, domain-driven, and registry-based structure* as shown in your `/app/` breakdown (with modular tools, core/shared logic, and schema validation via AJV/Zod).  ---  ## **Next Steps: Correction and Refined List**  You don’t need to decide these from scratch. Instead, you should confirm/clarify the following **(I’ve pre-filled based on your real direction):**  ---  ### **Project Initialization – Clarified Task List**  1. **Technology Stack**     * **Backend:** Python (Flask) for API, calculations, and export logic    * **Frontend:** Modular JavaScript (offline-first, upgradeable to React/TypeScript), delivered as a PWA first    * **Docs:** MkDocs (guides), Sphinx (API)    * **Local Data:** IndexedDB/JSON file for persistent offline storage (web); optional upgrade path to Electron desktop  2. **Implementation Priority**     * Begin with the **Air Duct Sizer module** (already underway), then move to Estimating App and remaining core tools.    * Foundation (core, services, schemas, validators, i18n) is built as needed for each new module.  3. **Database/Data Storage**     * Use browser-based/local storage (IndexedDB or JSON) for all data persistence in the MVP.    * No remote server DB for v1; architect for easy upgrade to server/cloud sync in the future.  4. **Deployment Target**     * Target **progressive web app (PWA)** for maximum offline/desktop reach and lowest friction to launch.    * Keep codebase compatible with Electron for future desktop release.  5. **Development Approach**     * Modular, domain-driven, registry-enabled architecture (as per `/app/` structure).    * Strict schema validation (AJV/Zod), strong separation of calculation logic, validators, and UI components.    * CI for lint, tests, and doc builds. Unit test and E2E coverage enforced per module.  ---  ## **What Still Needs Your Input (to make the plan actionable):**  * Do you want to **prioritize any module** after Air Duct Sizer? (e.g., Estimating App vs. Boiler Vent Sizer) * Do you want **multi-user/sync features** (which would require cloud DB) for MVP, or are you OK with strictly offline/local for now? * Do you want to **immediately support desktop** (Electron), or is PWA-first sufficient for launch?  ---  ## **Conclusion**  Your summary is *mostly correct*—with the above corrections, you can proceed directly to:  * Project scaffold and setup * Technology/tooling installation (Python, JS, CI, local storage config) * Module-by-module development following the priorities above * Testing, validation, and doc automation setup  **If you clarify the three bullet points above, you can immediately break ground on the next milestone.**  ---  **Final Answer:**  * Your understanding is accurate after the above refinements and corrections. * Proceed to clarify module priority, multi-user/cloud needs, and deployment preferences for the fastest and most correct launch trajectory.
