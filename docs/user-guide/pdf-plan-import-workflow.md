The PDF Plan Background Support feature enables professional HVAC engineers to import architectural floor plans as backgrounds for accurate duct design. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for the complete workflow from plan import to professional design output.

## üìã Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Browser**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **File Format**: PDF files (architectural floor plans)
- **Recommended File Size**: Under 10MB for optimal performance
- **Resolution**: Plans with clear line work and readable dimensions

### Professional Workflow Context
This feature is designed for HVAC professionals who:
- Work with architectural floor plans in PDF format
- Need accurate scaling for duct sizing calculations
- Require precise placement of HVAC components
- Generate professional design documentation

## üîß Step-by-Step PDF Import Workflow

### Phase 1: Plan Import

#### Step 1: Access the Import Function
1. **Open Air Duct Sizer**: Navigate to the Air Duct Sizer tool
2. **Locate Import Button**: Find the "Import Plan" button in the toolbar (üìÑ icon)
3. **Click Import Plan**: This opens the file selection dialog

#### Step 2: Select PDF File
1. **Choose File**: Browse and select your architectural PDF plan
2. **Supported Formats**: Ensure file is in PDF format
3. **File Size Check**: Verify file is under recommended 10MB limit
4. **Click Open**: Confirm file selection

#### Step 3: Initial Plan Loading
1. **Processing Indicator**: Wait for PDF processing to complete
2. **Plan Appears**: PDF renders as background layer behind canvas grid
3. **Initial View**: Plan appears at default scale and position

### Phase 2: Scale Calibration

#### Step 4: Activate Scale Tool
1. **Press 'L' Key**: Activates the interactive scale calibration tool
2. **Tool Indicator**: Scale tool becomes active (cursor changes)
3. **Instructions**: Follow on-screen prompts for calibration

#### Step 5: Set Known Distance
1. **Identify Reference**: Find a known dimension on the plan (e.g., room width, door opening)
2. **Draw Scale Line**: Click and drag to draw a line along the known distance
3. **Enter Real Measurement**: Input the actual real-world measurement
4. **Units Selection**: Choose appropriate units (feet, meters, etc.)
5. **Confirm Scale**: Click "Set Scale" to apply calibration

#### Step 6: Verify Scale Accuracy
1. **Test Measurements**: Use drawing tools to verify other known dimensions
2. **Adjust if Needed**: Repeat scale calibration if measurements are inaccurate
3. **Scale Indicator**: Note the scale ratio displayed in the interface

### Phase 3: Professional Design Workflow

#### Step 7: Design Over Plan
1. **Room Tool**: Draw rooms over architectural spaces
2. **Duct Tool**: Route ductwork following architectural constraints
3. **Equipment Tool**: Place HVAC equipment in designated areas
4. **Accurate Placement**: Use PDF background for precise positioning

#### Step 8: Leverage Plan Details
1. **Wall Locations**: Align ductwork with structural elements
2. **Ceiling Heights**: Reference architectural notes for vertical clearances
3. **Mechanical Rooms**: Identify equipment placement areas
4. **Access Routes**: Plan ductwork paths considering maintenance access

## üé® Professional Design Best Practices

### Plan Preparation
- **High Quality PDFs**: Use vector-based PDFs when possible
- **Clear Dimensions**: Ensure architectural dimensions are readable
- **Consistent Scale**: Verify all plan views use the same scale
- **Layer Management**: Use plans with clear line weights and organization

### Scale Calibration Tips
- **Use Longest Available Dimension**: More accurate than short references
- **Verify Multiple Points**: Check scale accuracy at different plan locations
- **Document Scale Ratio**: Record the scale for project documentation
- **Re-calibrate if Needed**: Don't hesitate to adjust scale for accuracy

### Design Workflow Optimization
- **Start with Major Spaces**: Design main distribution first
- **Follow Architectural Logic**: Respect structural and spatial constraints
- **Consider Coordination**: Plan for other building systems (electrical, plumbing)
- **Maintain Professional Standards**: Follow SMACNA and ASHRAE guidelines

## üîç Quality Assurance Checklist

### Import Verification
- [ ] PDF loads completely without errors
- [ ] Plan is clearly visible and readable
- [ ] No distortion or aspect ratio issues
- [ ] File size is manageable for system performance

### Scale Calibration Verification
- [ ] Known dimensions measure correctly
- [ ] Scale ratio is documented
- [ ] Multiple reference points verified
- [ ] Units are appropriate for project

### Design Quality Verification
- [ ] Ductwork aligns with architectural elements
- [ ] Equipment placement follows plan constraints
- [ ] Room boundaries match architectural spaces
- [ ] Design follows professional standards

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization Tips

### File Management
- **Optimize PDF Size**: Compress large files before import
- **Single Page Plans**: Use individual floor plan pages
- **Clean Line Work**: Remove unnecessary details that don't affect HVAC design
- **Standard Formats**: Use common architectural scales (1/4" = 1', 1:100, etc.)

### Browser Performance
- **Close Unused Tabs**: Free up browser memory
- **Regular Refresh**: Refresh browser if performance degrades
- **Monitor Memory**: Watch for memory usage with large files
- **Save Frequently**: Save project progress regularly

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### PDF Import Problems
**Issue**: PDF doesn't load or appears blank
- **Solution**: Check file format, try re-saving PDF, verify file isn't corrupted

**Issue**: PDF appears distorted or stretched
- **Solution**: Check original PDF aspect ratio, re-export from source if needed

**Issue**: PDF is too large or slow to load
- **Solution**: Compress PDF, reduce resolution, or split into smaller sections

### Scale Calibration Issues
**Issue**: Scale tool doesn't activate
- **Solution**: Ensure PDF is loaded, try pressing 'L' key again, refresh if needed

**Issue**: Measurements don't match known dimensions
- **Solution**: Re-calibrate using a different reference dimension, verify PDF accuracy

**Issue**: Scale appears inconsistent across plan
- **Solution**: Check if PDF was created from multiple sources, use single reference point

## üìä Professional Output Standards

### Documentation Requirements
- **Scale Notation**: Include scale ratio in project documentation
- **Plan Source**: Document original architectural plan source and date
- **Calibration Notes**: Record calibration method and reference dimensions
- **Design Standards**: Note applicable SMACNA/ASHRAE standards used

### Quality Metrics
- **Dimensional Accuracy**: ¬±2% tolerance for scaled measurements
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, organized design layout
- **Code Compliance**: Adherence to local building and mechanical codes
- **Coordination**: Proper integration with architectural constraints

## üéØ Success Criteria

A successful PDF import and design workflow should achieve:
- **Accurate Scaling**: Measurements within professional tolerance
- **Efficient Design**: Streamlined workflow from import to completion
- **Professional Quality**: Output suitable for construction documentation
- **Code Compliance**: Design meets applicable standards and regulations
