# Importing PDF Plans

The Air Duct Sizer allows you to load a PDF floor plan as a background image. Use the *Import Plan* button in the toolbar to select a PDF file. Once imported, the first page of the PDF is rendered behind your drawing objects.

To establish an accurate scale, choose the **Scale** tool from the toolbar (or press `L`). Click two points on a known dimension of the plan, then enter the real-world distance when prompted. The application calculates the plan scale and stores it with your project so the plan reloads with the correct scale.
