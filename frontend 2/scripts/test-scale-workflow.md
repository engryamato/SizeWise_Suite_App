# Scale Calibration Workflow Test Plan

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:3001
- ✅ Air Duct Sizer page accessible
- ✅ PDF file available for testing (architectural plan with known dimensions)

### Test 1: Basic Scale Tool Activation
1. **Navigate to Air Duct Sizer**: http://localhost:3001/air-duct-sizer
2. **Check Toolbar**: Verify Scale tool is visible with Ruler icon
3. **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press 'L' key to activate scale tool
4. **Visual Feedback**: Confirm scale tool becomes active (highlighted)

**Expected Results:**
- Scale tool button shows Ruler icon (not generic pointer)
- 'L' key activates scale tool
- Active tool is visually indicated

### Test 2: PDF Import and Scale Status
1. **Import PDF**: Click "Import Plan" button
2. **Select File**: Choose a PDF with known dimensions
3. **Check Status**: Verify scale status shows "Not Calibrated"
4. **PDF Display**: Confirm PDF appears as background

**Expected Results:**
- PDF imports successfully
- Scale status indicator shows "⚠ Not Calibrated"
- PDF renders behind canvas grid

### Test 3: Scale Calibration Process
1. **Activate Scale Tool**: Press 'L' or click scale tool
2. **Draw Measurement Line**: Click and drag on a known dimension in PDF
3. **Calibration Panel**: Verify modal opens with pixel distance
4. **Enter Measurements**: 
   - Measured distance: 1 ft
   - Actual distance: 10 ft
5. **Set Scale**: Click "Set Scale" button

**Expected Results:**
- Modal opens after drawing line
- Pixel distance is calculated and displayed
- Preview scale shows: 10 ft / [pixel distance] = [scale] ft/px
- Scale is applied successfully
- Modal closes after setting scale

### Test 4: Unit Conversion Testing
1. **Activate Scale Tool**: Press 'L'
2. **Draw Line**: On known dimension
3. **Test Different Units**:
   - Measured: 12 inches, Actual: 1 foot
   - Measured: 30.48 cm, Actual: 1 foot
   - Measured: 1 meter, Actual: 3.28084 feet

**Expected Results:**
- All unit combinations calculate correctly
- Preview scale updates in real-time
- Final scale is consistent regardless of input units

### Test 5: Scale Status Validation
1. **After Calibration**: Check toolbar scale status
2. **Verify Display**: Should show "✓ Calibrated ([scale] ft/px)"
3. **Project Persistence**: Refresh page and verify scale persists

**Expected Results:**
- Status changes to green "✓ Calibrated"
- Scale value is displayed accurately
- Scale persists across page refreshes

### Test 6: Error Handling
1. **Invalid Inputs**: Try zero or negative values
2. **Very Small Lines**: Draw tiny measurement lines
3. **Cancel Operation**: Test cancel button functionality

**Expected Results:**
- Validation errors show for invalid inputs
- Minimum line length enforced
- Cancel button closes modal without changes

### Test 7: Professional UI/UX
1. **Visual Design**: Check modal styling and animations
2. **Accessibility**: Test keyboard navigation
3. **Responsive**: Test on different screen sizes
4. **Loading States**: Verify loading indicators during calculation

**Expected Results:**
- Professional glassmorphism design
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible form controls
- Responsive layout

## Performance Benchmarks

### Scale Calculation Speed
- **Target**: < 100ms for scale calculation
- **Test**: Measure time from "Set Scale" click to modal close

### PDF Rendering
- **Target**: < 2 seconds for typical architectural PDF
- **Test**: Time from file selection to PDF display

### Memory Usage
- **Target**: No memory leaks during repeated calibrations
- **Test**: Perform 10+ calibrations and monitor memory

## Integration Points

### Store Synchronization
- ✅ UI Store planScale updates
- ✅ Project Store plan_scale updates
- ✅ Both stores remain synchronized

### Canvas Integration
- ✅ Scale tool integrates with existing drawing tools
- ✅ PDF background respects scale changes
- ✅ Measurement tools use calibrated scale

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- ✅ 'L' key activates scale tool
- ✅ Escape key cancels operations
- ✅ No conflicts with existing shortcuts

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Scale calibration calculates correctly
- [x] Unit conversion works for all supported units
- [x] Scale persists with project data
- [x] Professional UI with proper validation

### Technical Requirements
- [x] TypeScript type safety
- [x] React component best practices
- [x] Zustand store integration
- [x] Error handling and validation

### User Experience
- [x] Intuitive workflow
- [x] Clear visual feedback
- [x] Accessible design
- [x] Professional appearance

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Single page PDF support only
- Scale applies globally to entire project
- No support for different scales per drawing layer

### Future Enhancements
- Multi-page PDF support
- Layer-specific scaling
- Scale templates for common plan types
- Automatic scale detection from PDF metadata
